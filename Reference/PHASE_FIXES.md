- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Result**: Modular admin dashboard now has a fully functional authentication system that works with both Firebase and fallback authentication, allowing users to log in successfully and access the dashboard functionality.

## Phase 0 Fix - Contracts API Endpoint Fix
**Issue**: The admin dashboard was failing to load contracts with a 400 error because the `/api/contracts` endpoint only supported individual PDF file downloads and didn't handle requests for listing all contracts.

**Root Cause**: The contracts API endpoint was designed to serve individual PDF files when a `filename` parameter was provided, but the contract manager was calling `/api/contracts` without parameters to get a list of all contracts. This caused a 400 error since the endpoint required a filename parameter.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced GET Handler**: Modified the GET request handler to return the list of all contracts when no filename parameter is provided
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing PDF serving functionality when filename parameter is provided
3. **Data Source Integration**: Integrated with the existing `uploaded-contracts.json` file to provide contract listings
4. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for missing contract data files
5. **Logging**: Enhanced logging to track contract listing requests and responses

**Files Modified**:
- `api/contracts.js` - Enhanced GET handler to support both contract listing and PDF serving
- `TESTING_SYSTEM_README.md` - Added documentation for contracts API testing
- `PHASE_FIXES.md` - Documented the API fix

**API Behavior Changes**:
- **GET `/api/contracts`** (no parameters): Now returns list of all contracts from uploaded-contracts.json
- **GET `/api/contracts?filename=name.pdf`**: Continues to serve individual PDF files (unchanged)
- **POST `/api/contracts`**: Uploads new contracts to GitHub repository (unchanged)

**Technical Features**:
- Dual-purpose GET endpoint handling
- Seamless integration with existing contract data structure
- Proper error handling for missing data files
- Maintains backward compatibility with PDF download functionality
- Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring

**Result**: Admin dashboard now loads contracts successfully without 400 errors, contract manager displays all contracts properly, and the API maintains full backward compatibility for PDF downloads.

**Additional Fix**: Updated contract manager to properly handle the API response data structure, ensuring contracts are loaded from the `uploadedContracts` array instead of the non-existent `contracts` array.

## Phase 0 Fix - DashboardManager Module Creation
**Issue**: The admin dashboard lacked a centralized management module for core functionality, stats, and layout management, making it difficult to maintain consistent dashboard behavior and integrate with other modules.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard functionality was scattered across multiple files and inline scripts, lacking proper modularization and Component Library integration.

**Solutions Implemented**:

- `PHASE_FIXES.md` - Documented module creation progress

**Results**: DashboardManager module now provides centralized dashboard management with professional UI, real-time stats, authentication handling, and seamless integration with other refactored modules.

## Phase 0 Fix - DropdownManager Module Refactoring
**Issue**: The DropdownManager module was using inline styles and lacked proper component structure, making it inconsistent with other refactored modules and harder to maintain.

**Root Cause**: The module had hardcoded HTML strings with inline styles instead of using the Component Library and proper CSS classes, creating inconsistency with the refactored architecture.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Component Library Integration**: Refactored to use Component Library architecture and wait for library readiness
2. **Modular DOM Creation**: Replaced inline HTML strings with proper DOM element creation methods
3. **CSS Class Structure**: Removed all inline styles and implemented proper CSS class-based styling

## Phase 1 Fix - API Endpoint Infrastructure & Environment Detection
**Issue**: User portal was failing to load data due to 404 errors on API endpoints when accessed from production domain, and missing API endpoints for local development.

**Root Cause**: 
1. User portal was being accessed from `collaborate.cochranfilms.com` but API calls were relative paths
2. Production server lacked the required API endpoints
3. Local development server was missing several API endpoints
4. No environment detection to handle local vs production API calls

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Environment Detection System**: Added automatic detection of localhost vs production environment
2. **Dynamic API Base URL**: Implemented `API_BASE` configuration that automatically uses `http://localhost:8000` for local development
3. **Missing API Endpoints**: Added `/api/uploaded-contracts` and `/api/github/file/:filename` GET endpoints
4. **Comprehensive API Testing**: Created test script to verify all endpoints work correctly
5. **Server Restart & Configuration**: Fixed server configuration and ensured all endpoints are properly routed

**Files Modified**:

**Result**: User portal now works seamlessly in both local development (localhost:8000) and production environments, with all API endpoints functioning correctly and proper fallback handling.

## System Architecture Notes

### Centralized Data Structure Principle
**CRITICAL**: All user-specific data must be stored in `users.json` as the single source of truth.

**Rule**: Any new user input, field, or category that is connected to a user must be added to the data structure inside `users.json`. The UI design of any new function should pull data from `users.json` as long as it is connected with user-specific data.

**Current Centralized Structure**:
```json
{
  "users": {
    "userName": {
      "profile": { /* user profile data */ },
      "contract": { /* contract information */ },
      "jobs": { /* job assignments */ },
      "performance": { /* performance reviews */ },
      "payment": { /* payment information */ },
      "notifications": [ /* user notifications */ ]
      // Add new user-specific categories here
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth eliminates data fragmentation
- Consistent data across admin dashboard and user portal
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- No sync issues between multiple JSON files
- Better reliability and data integrity

**Implementation**: Both admin-dashboard.html and user-portal.html now read from centralized `users.json` for all user-related data.

## Phase 1 Fix - Quantum Neural Login Screen Redesign 2025 (Latest)
**Issue**: The existing login screen was outdated and lacked visual appeal, with basic styling that didn't reflect modern 2025 technology standards.

**Root Cause**: The login screen used basic CSS with minimal animations and no futuristic visual elements, making it appear dated and unimpressive.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Complete Visual Overhaul**: Transformed from basic login to quantum neural network-inspired design
2. **Neural Network Background**: Added animated neural nodes with dynamic connections
3. **Holographic Particles**: Implemented floating particle system with interactive effects

**Result**: A completely revolutionary login screen that looks like nothing seen before - a true 2025-level, technologically advanced design that stands out from any boring login interface.

## Phase 2 Fix - User Deletion System
**Issue**: Users weren't being deleted from `users.json` and changes weren't being pushed to GitHub when admins deleted users from the admin dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The `deleteUser` function in `admin-dashboard.html` only deleted from the local `window.users` object but didn't persist changes to `users.json` or GitHub.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced deleteUser Function**: Updated to call `updateUsersOnGitHub()` after deletion
2. **Created update-users API**: New `/api/update-users` endpoint for secure GitHub updates
3. **Added PDF Cleanup**: Enhanced deletion flow to include PDF file cleanup
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. **Created Test Scripts**: Added `test-admin-user-deletion-system.js` and `test-admin-deletion-simple.js`

**Files Modified**:
- `admin-dashboard.html`: Enhanced deleteUser function with proper persistence
- `api/update-users.js`: New API endpoint for updating users.json and GitHub
- `test-admin-user-deletion-system.js`: Comprehensive browser-based test

**Test Results**:
- ✅ User deletion now persists to users.json
- ✅ Changes are pushed to GitHub automatically
- ✅ PDF files are cleaned up when users are deleted
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Full test coverage for deletion workflow

## Phase 2 Fix - Error User Not Found Alert
**Issue**: Error alert shows up in user-portal.html as soon as the page loads, even before user login attempts. Continues to show after successful login and page reload.

**Root Cause**: The `checkUserInSystem()` function is being called immediately when Firebase auth state changes, even when no user is properly authenticated.

**Fix**: Modify the authentication flow to only check user in system after proper authentication and prevent premature error alerts.

## Phase 2 Fix - Undefined Job Status
**Issue**: When users log into user-portal.html, their job status shows "undefined" despite jobs being properly defined in users.json.

**Root Cause**: The job display logic is not properly accessing the job data structure from users.json.

**Fix**: Update the job display logic to correctly access and display job information from the users.json structure.

## Phase 3 Fix - Performance Review Popup Persistence
**Issue**: Performance review orange popup in admin-dashboard.html stays up too long. Should disappear immediately when admin clicks "write review".

**Root Cause**: The popup dismissal logic is not properly implemented when the review modal is opened.

**Fix**: Add immediate popup dismissal when the performance review modal is opened.

## Phase 4 Fix - Notification Menu Z-Index
**Issue**: Notification menu in admin-dashboard.html falls behind content. Should come to forefront when clicked. Clicking notifications should navigate to relevant screens and only dismiss upon completion.

**Root Cause**: Z-index issues and missing navigation logic for notifications.

**Fix**: Update CSS z-index and implement proper notification click handlers with navigation logic.

## Phase 5 Fix - Take Action Button Logic
**Issue**: In user-portal.html "Your Current Jobs" section, "Take Action" button is always present even when user is waiting on admin (no action needed).

**Root Cause**: The action button logic doesn't differentiate between user actions and admin actions.

**Fix**: Implement conditional logic to only show "Take Action" when user actually needs to take action.

## Phase 6 Fix - Status Manager in Performance Review
**Issue**: Status manager dropdown in performance review modal doesn't properly update job status in users.json.

**Root Cause**: The status update logic is not properly connected to the centralized users.json system.

**Fix**: Implement proper status update flow that persists changes to users.json and GitHub.

## Phase 7 Fix - Enhanced Notification System & User Portal Redesign (Latest)
**Issue**: 
1. Notification system was silent/disabled, preventing users from seeing real-time updates
2. User Portal had basic Dart theme that looked too corporate and basic
3. No real-time monitoring of JSON file changes (jobs-data.json, users.json)

**Solutions Implemented**:

### Enhanced Notification System
1. **Targeted Notifications**: Users get notifications for user-specific actions, admins get admin-specific notifications
2. **User Notifications**: Payment method changes, job status updates, contract signings, profile changes
3. **Admin Notifications**: User management, job assignments, system updates, administrative actions
4. **No JSON Monitoring**: Removed automatic JSON file change notifications that were not user-relevant

**Files Modified**:
- `admin-dashboard.html`: Enhanced notification system with JSON monitoring

    });
    
    // Populate location dropdown (shared)
    const locationSelect = document.getElementById('freelancerLocation');
    window.dropdownOptions.locations.forEach(location => {
        // Creates options for user locations
    });
    
    // Populate rate dropdown (shared)
    const rateSelect = document.getElementById('freelancerRate');
    window.dropdownOptions.rates.forEach(rate => {
        // Creates options for user rates
    });
}
```

#### **Job Assignment Dropdowns**
```javascript
function populateJobAssignmentDropdowns() {
    // Populate project types dropdown (job-specific)
    const projectTypesSelect = document.getElementById('projectTypeSelect');
    window.dropdownOptions.projectTypes.forEach(type => {
        // Creates options for job project types
    });
    
    // Populate location dropdown (shared)
    const locationSelect = document.getElementById('jobLocationSelect');
    window.dropdownOptions.locations.forEach(location => {
        // Creates options for job locations
    });
}
```

### **🎯 Summary: Why This System Works Perfectly**

1. **🎭 Roles are user-specific**: What the user does professionally
2. **🎬 Project Types are job-specific**: What type of project the job is
3. **📍 Locations are shared**: Both users and jobs use the same location options
4. **💰 Rates are shared**: Both users and jobs use the same rate options
5. **📋 Single source**: All options controlled by `dropdown-options.json`
6. **🔧 Easy management**: Admin can add/remove options from one interface
7. **👥 Clean user experience**: Forms only show relevant fields
8. **📊 No data conflicts**: Clear separation prevents confusion

This architecture ensures that your system is both powerful and user-friendly, with clear separation between user data and job data while maintaining consistency through a single source of truth.
**Issue**: Status manager in performance review editor may be unnecessary unless linked to performance.json.

**Root Cause**: Status dropdown exists but may not be properly integrated with the performance review data structure.

**Fix**: Verify status manager integration with performance.json and remove if unnecessary.

## Phase 7 Fix - Save Review Function Error
**Issue**: When admin clicks 'save review' in admin-dashboard.html, nothing happens due to missing `updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub` function.

**Error**: `admin-dashboard:3670 Uncaught ReferenceError: updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub is not defined`

**Root Cause**: The function `updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub` is referenced but not defined.

**Fix**: Implement the missing `updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub` function or replace with proper save logic.

## Phase 8 Fix - Performance Reviews UI Enhancement
**Issue**: Performance reviews section needs to be more personalized and show job-specific information in the card header.

**Enhancement**: 
- Update card header to show job title instead of generic "Performance Review"
- Add personalized welcome message with user's name
- Enhance design with polished, caring touch that shows Cochran Films cares about user growth
- Improve empty state with more welcoming and informative design
- Add growth encouragement section with supportive messaging

**Implementation**: Enhanced user-portal.html performance reviews display with:

## Phase 9 Fix - Unwanted Popup Notifications
**Issue**: Users and admins are getting unwanted popup notifications every time a task is performed in both user-portal.html and admin-dashboard.html. These notifications need to be removed completely.

**Root Cause**: Both files have `showNotification()` and `showEnhancedNotification()` functions that create popup notifications for every action, even successful ones.

**Fix**: 
- Disabled `showNotification()` function in both files to prevent unwanted popups
- Disabled `showEnhancedNotification()` function in user-portal.html
- Replaced all `alert()` calls with `console.log()` for silent logging
- Preserved the sophisticated notification system for important notifications
- All notifications now logged to console instead of displayed as popups
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify changes
- Added backup files for safety

**Implementation**: 
- Modified user-portal.html: Disabled popup notifications while preserving sophisticated system
- Modified admin-dashboard.html: Disabled popup notifications while preserving sophisticated system
- Created test scripts to verify notification removal
- All unwanted popup notifications successfully removed
- Sophisticated notification system remains intact for important notifications

## Phase 9 Fix - Seamless Creator Update System
**Issue**: When admin updates user information from users.json, the changes are not reflected in the user portal. The notification appears successful in admin-dashboard.html but this is only a local save.

**Root Cause**: The user portal was reading from the local `/api/users` endpoint which only reads the local `users.json` file, not the GitHub version. Additionally, the user portal had a 2-minute cache that prevented immediate updates.

**Fix**: Implemented a seamless update system with the following improvements:

### API Layer Fix
- **Updated `/api/users` endpoint**: Now fetches data from GitHub first, then falls back to local file
- **Added metadata tracking**: API response includes data source (GitHub vs local) and timestamp
- **Automatic local sync**: When GitHub data is fetched, it updates the local file for consistency

### User Portal Cache Optimization
- **Reduced cache time**: Changed from 2 minutes to 30 seconds for more responsive updates
- **Added force refresh function**: `forceRefreshCache()` function to manually clear cache
- **Enhanced update flow**: After successful updates, cache is cleared to force fresh data load

### Data Flow
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Updates local `users.json` → Pushes to GitHub via `updateUsersOnGitHub()`
2. **User Portal**: Calls `/api/users` → Fetches from GitHub first → Updates local file → Returns fresh data
3. **Cache Management**: 30-second cache with manual refresh capability

**Implementation**: 
- Modified `api/users.js` to prioritize GitHub data
- Updated user-portal.html cache timing and added refresh functions
- Created test scripts to verify seamless update flow

**Benefits**:
- Real-time updates between admin dashboard and user portal
- Consistent data across all systems
- Improved user experience with immediate feedback
- Robust fallback mechanisms for reliability

## Phase 9 Fix - Login Screen Design Enhancement
**Issue**: Login screen needs a more sophisticated, modern design with glassy, floating 3D effects.

**Enhancement**: 
- Implement glassy, lowered opacity design with 3D floating effects
- Add perspective and transform-style: preserve-3d for depth
- Enhance form container with backdrop-filter blur and sophisticated shadows
- Improve floating background elements with better animations
- Add hover effects and micro-interactions for better UX
- Implement gradient overlays and shimmer effects on buttons
- Enhance typography with better spacing and visual hierarchy

**Implementation**: Enhanced user-portal.html login screen with:
- 3D perspective and floating animations
- Glassy form container with blur effects and sophisticated shadows
- Enhanced button hover effects with shimmer animations
- Improved floating background elements with varied animation durations
- Better visual hierarchy with enhanced typography and spacing
- Professional "next level touch" design standards
- Personalized welcome header with user name and caring messaging
- Job-specific review card headers
- Enhanced visual design with gradients and improved styling
- Growth encouragement section with supportive messaging
- Improved empty state with information cards and encouragement

## Phase 9 Fix - Payment Method Update Conflict Resolution
**Issue**: Payment method updates in user-portal.html fail with GitHub 409 conflict errors when users.json has been modified since last fetch.

**Error**: `Failed to update users.json on GitHub: 409 - {"error":"users.json does not match efcd564420c59d85fb368e9f33275a6a84ef9b39"}`

**Root Cause**: The SHA used for GitHub updates becomes outdated when the file is modified by other processes, causing conflicts.

**Fix**: Implement retry mechanism with fresh SHA fetching and better error handling:
- Added retry logic with up to 3 attempts
- Fetch fresh SHA before each update attempt
- Specific error handling for 409 conflicts
- Enhanced user feedback with specific error messages
- Graceful fallback to local storage when GitHub update fails

## Phase 10 Fix - Sophisticated Notification System Implementation
**Issue**: Notifications in admin-dashboard.html and user-portal.html are not working properly and not updating to show completed performance reviews, payment status updates, and other important events.

**Enhancement**: Completely reconstructed the notification system with centralized storage and smart triggers:
- **Centralized Storage**: Created notifications.json and API endpoint for persistent storage
- **Smart Triggers**: Automatic notifications for performance reviews, payment updates, contract status, job completions
- **Rich Notifications**: Action buttons, priority levels, and detailed information
- **Real-time Updates**: 30-second polling for automatic notification generation
- **Enhanced UI**: Priority indicators, action required badges, and improved styling
- **Cross-platform Sync**: Notifications work seamlessly between admin and user portals

**Implementation**: 
- Created `/api/notifications.js` endpoint for centralized storage
- Enhanced notification system in both admin-dashboard.html and user-portal.html
- Added smart triggers for performance reviews, payment methods, contracts, and jobs
- Implemented rich notification display with action buttons and priority indicators
- Added real-time polling and automatic notification generation
- Enhanced CSS for better visual feedback and user experience

## Phase 11 Fix - Automated Testing System Implementation (REMOVED)
**Issue**: Manual testing of workflow components was time-consuming and error-prone, requiring manual verification of each system component including job creation/deletion, user management, contract operations, performance reviews, notifications, and system integrations.

**Enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive automated testing system with 14 tests covering all major workflow components, providing 100% test success rate and replacing hours of manual testing with 30-second automated validation.

**REMOVAL**: The automated testing system was removed to eliminate interference with PDF download functionality. The system was causing conflicts with the main application workflow and was not needed for live testing scenarios.

**Implementation**: 
- ~~Created `test-runner.js` with 14 automated tests covering all system components~~
- ~~Built `test-dashboard.html` with beautiful modern UI for web-based test execution~~
- ~~Implemented `run-tests.js` command-line interface for direct terminal execution~~
- ~~Added `/api/test-runner.js` and `/api/export-results.js` for API integration~~
- ~~Created comprehensive documentation with `TESTING_SYSTEM_README.md` and `AUTOMATED_TESTING_SUMMARY.md`~~
- ~~Achieved 100% test success rate (14/14 tests passing)~~
- ~~Implemented smart recommendation system for issue detection and resolution~~
- ~~Added multiple export formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML) for test results~~
- ~~Integrated with existing server.js for seamless operation~~

**Test Coverage**:
- ~~System Health (3 tests): Server health, file system access, API endpoints~~
- ~~User Management (2 tests): User creation and deletion~~

**Results**: ~~100% success rate with all 14 tests passing, providing comprehensive validation of entire workflow system in under 30 seconds.~~ System removed to eliminate conflicts with PDF download functionality.

## Phase 12 Fix - Complete Data Centralization & PDF Deletion Enhancement
**Issue**: When admin deletes a user in admin-dashboard.html, the PDF contract files in the /contracts folder connected to the user via Contract ID were not being deleted. This was due to data fragmentation across multiple JSON files (users.json, uploaded-contracts.json, performance.json, event-planners.json, etc.) creating synchronization issues and inconsistent data structures.

## Phase 13 Fix - Performance Data Migration to Centralized System
**Issue**: Performance data was still stored in the old `performance-data.js` file instead of the centralized `users.json` system, creating data fragmentation and inconsistency.

**Enhancement**: Migrated performance data to the centralized system and updated user portal to use the new structure:
- **Data Migration**: Extracted performance data from `performance-data.js` and migrated to `users.json`
- **Centralized Storage**: Performance reviews now stored within user objects in the centralized system
- **Updated User Portal**: Modified user-portal.html to load performance data from centralized system
- **Removed Dependencies**: Removed `performance-data.js` script references from user portal
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained API fallback system for robust data loading

**Implementation**: 
- Created `extract-performance-data.js` to extract data from `performance-data.js`
- Ran `migrate-performance-to-centralized.js` to migrate 2 performance reviews
- Updated user-portal.html to load performance data from `/api/users` and `/users.json`
- Removed `performance-data.js` script reference from user portal
- Maintained fallback system for robust data loading
- Successfully migrated performance reviews for Cody Cochran and Dede Jackson

**Results**: Performance data now fully integrated into centralized system, eliminating data fragmentation and improving system consistency.

## Phase 14 Fix - Admin Dashboard Centralized System Integration
**Issue**: Admin dashboard was still using the old performance-data.js system and saving performance data to separate performance.json files instead of the centralized users.json system.

**Enhancement**: Updated admin dashboard to fully use the centralized system:
- **Performance Data Loading**: Already using centralized users.json for loading performance reviews
- **Performance Data Saving**: Updated to save performance data directly to users.json instead of performance.json
- **System Totals**: Added automatic counting of performance reviews in system totals
- **Dependency Removal**: Removed performance-data.js script reference from admin dashboard
- **Notification Updates**: Updated notifications to reflect centralized system usage

**Implementation**: 
- Modified performance review saving to update user objects in centralized system
- Removed old updatePerformanceReviewsFile() function that saved to performance.json
- Updated updateUsersOnGitHub() to include system totals for performance reviews
- Removed performance-data.js script reference from admin dashboard
- Updated notification messages to reflect centralized system usage

**Results**: Admin dashboard now fully integrated with centralized system, ensuring all performance data is stored in users.json alongside user data.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Contract data scattered across multiple JSON files with different structures
2. PDF deletion logic only checked uploaded-contracts.json, not user-specific contract data
3. No centralized data management causing data consistency issues
4. Multiple data sources creating complex relationships and maintenance overhead
5. **RESOLVED**: Removed uploaded-contracts.json and performance.json files as they are no longer needed with centralized users.json structure

**Enhancement**: Implemented complete data centralization with enhanced PDF deletion system:
- **Centralized Data Structure**: Migrated all user data, contracts, performance reviews, and system metadata into single `users.json` file
- **Enhanced PDF Deletion**: Updated `deleteUser()` function to automatically delete associated PDF files when users are deleted
- **Unified Data Management**: Single source of truth eliminates data fragmentation and synchronization issues
- **Improved Data Consistency**: All user-related data now stored in consistent structure under each user object

**Implementation**:
- **Migration Script**: Created `migrate-to-centralized.js` to consolidate all existing data from multiple JSON files
- **New Data Structure**: Implemented comprehensive centralized structure with user profiles, contracts, jobs, performance, payment, and notifications
- **Enhanced Delete Function**: Updated `deleteUser()` to check for associated PDF files and delete them via `/api/delete-pdf` endpoint
- **Updated API Endpoints**: Modified `/api/delete-pdf.js` to work with centralized data structure
- **Data Migration**: Successfully migrated 10 users, 7 contracts, and system metadata to centralized structure
- **Backup System**: Automatic backup creation before migration to prevent data loss

**New Centralized Structure**:
```json
{
  "users": {
    "userName": {
      "profile": { email, password, role, location, etc. },
      "contract": { contractId, fileName, status, signedDate, etc. },
      "jobs": { job objects },
      "performance": { review data },
      "payment": { method, status, lastPayment },
      "notifications": [ notification objects ]
    }
  },
  "system": {
    "statusOptions": { projectStatus, paymentStatus },
    "totalUsers": 0,
    "totalContracts": 0,
    "totalReviews": 0,
    "lastUpdated": "date"
  }
}
```

**Results**: 
- ✅ Complete data centralization eliminating fragmentation issues
- ✅ Automatic PDF deletion when users are deleted
- ✅ Single source of truth for all user-related data
- ✅ Improved data consistency and maintenance

## Phase 9 Fix - Payment Status Update Issues
**Issue**: Users experiencing 30-second to 1-minute delays when making changes on user-portal.html, causing confusion when switching tabs. Payment status updates not saving to users.json properly, and performance reviews being created for 'undefined' user instead of actual user names.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Data refresh intervals were too slow (30 seconds)
2. Performance review system not properly handling different user data structures
3. Project Status Manager modal showing "undefined" for project titles
4. Payment status updates not immediately reflecting in UI

**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive fixes for immediate real-time updates and proper user identification:
- **Enhanced Real-time Updates**: Reduced refresh intervals from 30 seconds to 2 seconds for main data and 1 second for critical updates
- **Fixed User Identification**: Updated performance review system to handle both `userData.profile?.email` and `userData.email` structures

## Firebase Integration Architecture Notes
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Context**: Phase 12 Data Centralization Discussion

### Firebase Purpose & Integration
**Primary Function**: Login Security and Authentication Only
- **Firebase handles**: Email/password authentication, login sessions, security tokens, password hashing
- **users.json handles**: All user data, profiles, contracts, jobs, performance reviews, payment info

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Firebase (Login Security) ←→ users.json (All Data) ←→ Admin/User Interface
```

### Key Integration Points
1. **User Creation**: When admin creates user in admin-dashboard.html
   - Creates Firebase account for authentication
   - Stores all user data in centralized users.json
   - No data conflicts or confusion

2. **User Deletion**: When admin deletes user
   - Deletes Firebase authentication account
   - Removes user data from users.json
   - Deletes associated PDF files
   - Complete cleanup across all systems

3. **Login Process**: 
   - User authenticates via Firebase (email/password)
   - System then reads user data from users.json
   - Clean separation of concerns

### Benefits of This Architecture
- ✅ **Security**: Firebase handles all authentication securely
- ✅ **Data Management**: Single source of truth in users.json
- ✅ **No Conflicts**: Clear separation between auth and data
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to maintain and extend
- ✅ **Centralization**: All business data in one place

### Confirmation
The centralized data structure implemented in Phase 12 is the optimal solution because:
- Firebase continues to handle login security (as intended)
- users.json becomes the single source of truth for all user data
- No interference between authentication and data management
- Clean, maintainable architecture

### Migration Data Sources
**10 Users Migrated From:**
- `event-planners.json` (3 users): Sophie Anderson, Marcus Johnson, Elena Rodriguez
- `healthcare-staff.json` (3 users): Dr. Sarah Johnson, Nurse Maria Rodriguez, Dr. Michael Chen
- `real-estate-agents.json` (3 users): Jennifer Martinez, David Thompson, Amanda Wilson
- `freelancers.json` (1 user): Test User

**7 Contracts Identified:**
- CF-EVENT-001 (Marcus Johnson)
- CF-EVENT-002 (Elena Rodriguez)
- CF-HEALTH-001 (Nurse Maria Rodriguez)
- CF-HEALTH-002 (Dr. Michael Chen)
- CF-REAL-001 (David Thompson)
- CF-REAL-002 (Amanda Wilson)
- CF-1754276968364-P766Y (Test User)

### Important Discoveries
1. **Template Data**: The migrated users are from template files for future clients, not live project data
2. **Missing PDF Files**: Contract data exists in users.json but actual PDF files don't exist in /contracts/ folder
3. **CF Naming Convention**: "CF" is hardcoded prefix in contract IDs, not abbreviation for CochranFilms
4. **Firebase Integration**: Firebase password changes don't automatically sync to users.json (by design)

### Next Steps Required
1. **Template Organization**: Move template files to /templates subfolder
2. **Data Cleanup**: Clear users.json data while preserving structure
3. **Fresh Start**: Begin with clean slate for live testing
4. **PDF Handling**: Implement graceful handling for missing contract files

## Phase 12.1 Fix - Performance.json Integration Issue
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Context**: Post-centralization data synchronization problems

### Issue Identified
**Problem**: System still using separate `performance.json` file outside centralized `users.json` structure, causing:
- **Refresh rate/timing errors** in notifications
- **Duplicate notifications** for already completed actions
- **Users being kicked out** of user-portal.html unexpectedly
- **Data loading inconsistencies** between admin and user portals

### Root Cause Analysis
**Data Fragmentation**: 
- `performance.json` remains separate from centralized `users.json`
- Same issue as before with multiple JSON files causing synchronization problems
- Notifications system reading from separate performance.json file
- Refresh timing conflicts between centralized and separate data sources

### Solution Implemented
**COMPLETED**: Removed `performance.json` and `uploaded-contracts.json` files as they are no longer needed with centralized `users.json` structure.

**Final Structure**:
```
users.json (centralized + performance + contracts) ←→ jobs-data.json (separate)
```

### Implementation Completed
1. ✅ **Removed performance.json** - No longer needed with centralized structure
2. ✅ **Removed uploaded-contracts.json** - Integrated into users.json
3. ✅ **Updated API endpoints** - Removed references to deleted files

- ✅ **Helper Function**: Created `formatContractSignedDate()` to handle specific date format
- ✅ **Proper Date Parsing**: Handles "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM" format correctly
- ✅ **Consistent Display**: Shows actual signed dates instead of "processing"

#### **4. Updated Contract Status Functions**
- ✅ **Centralized Logic**: Updated `getUserContractStatus()` to read from centralized system
- ✅ **Simplified Structure**: Removed complex contract filtering and sorting
- ✅ **Direct Access**: Now reads contract data directly from `currentUser.contract`

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Updated contract ID structure in users.json
"contract": {
    "contractId": "Purple Spider", // User name instead of random ID
    "contractStatus": "signed",
    "contractSignedDate": "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM"
}

// Enhanced download function
async function downloadUserContract(jobId = null) {
    // Check if user has contract data in centralized system
    if (!currentUser || !currentUser.contract) {
        showNotification('❌ No contract found for your account.', 'error');
        return;
    }
    
    const userContract = currentUser.contract;
    
    // Create safe filename from user name
    const safeFileName = currentUser.name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]/g, '').replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim() + '.pdf';
    const contractUrl = `contracts/${safeFileName}`;
    
    // Download logic...
}

// Helper function for date formatting
function formatContractSignedDate(dateString) {
    if (!dateString) return 'Processing...';
    
    try {
        // Handle the specific format "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM"
        let date;
        if (dateString.includes(',')) {
            const parts = dateString.split(',');
            const datePart = parts[0].trim();
            const timePart = parts[1].trim();
            date = new Date(`${datePart} ${timePart}`);
        } else {
            date = new Date(dateString);
        }
        
        if (!isNaN(date.getTime())) {
            return date.toLocaleDateString();
        } else {
            return dateString; // Display as is
        }
    } catch (error) {
        return dateString; // Display as is
    }

    // Handle both nested and flattened contract data
    let userContract = null;
    
    if (currentUser.contract) {
        userContract = currentUser.contract;
        console.log('✅ Found contract data directly on currentUser');
    } else if (currentUser.contractStatus) {
        // Contract data might be flattened
        userContract = {
            contractStatus: currentUser.contractStatus,
            contractSignedDate: currentUser.contractSignedDate,
            contractId: currentUser.contractId || currentUser.name,
            contractUploadedDate: currentUser.contractUploadedDate
        };
        console.log('✅ Found flattened contract data on currentUser');
    } else {
        console.log('❌ No contract data found for user in centralized system');

    };
}

// Enhanced date formatting helper
function formatContractSignedDate(dateString) {
    if (!dateString) return 'Processing...';
    
    try {
        // Handle the specific format "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM"
        let date;
        if (dateString.includes(',')) {
            const parts = dateString.split(',');
            const datePart = parts[0].trim();
            const timePart = parts[1].trim();
            date = new Date(`${datePart} ${timePart}`);
        } else {
            date = new Date(dateString);
        }
        
        if (!isNaN(date.getTime())) {
            return date.toLocaleDateString();

## Phase 20 Fix - Data Structure Flattening Issue Resolution
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Context**: Contract data access issues due to data structure flattening during loading process

### Issues Identified
1. **Contract Data Not Found**: System still showing "❌ No contract data found for user in centralized system" despite contract data existing
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Functions looking for nested `currentUser.contract` but data is flattened
3. **Date Formatting Not Applied**: Date formatting helper function not being used in display logic
4. **Inconsistent Data Access**: Different functions expecting different data structures

### Root Cause Analysis
**Data Loading Process Issue**:
- **users.json** has nested structure: `users["Cody Cochran"].contract`
- **Data loading process** flattens this structure during `loadUsersData()` function
- **Flattened structure** puts contract data directly on `currentUser` object:
  - `currentUser.contractStatus`
  - `currentUser.contractSignedDate`
  - `currentUser.contractId`
  - `currentUser.contractUploadedDate`
- **Functions were looking** for `currentUser.contract` (nested) instead of flattened properties

**Code Analysis**:
```javascript
// Data loading process flattens the structure:
users = Object.entries(jsonData.users).map(([name, user]) => ({
    name: name,
    email: user.profile?.email,
    // ... other properties
    contractStatus: user.contract?.contractStatus || 'pending',
    contractSignedDate: user.contract?.contractSignedDate,
    contractUploadedDate: user.contract?.contractUploadedDate,
    contractId: user.contract?.contractId,
    // ... other properties
}));
```

### Solution Implemented
**Updated Contract Data Access for Flattened Structure**:

#### **1. Fixed getUserContractStatus Function**
- ✅ **Corrected Data Access**: Updated to look for flattened contract properties
- ✅ **Removed Nested Check**: Removed check for `currentUser.contract` (doesn't exist)
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track data access
- ✅ **Proper Fallback**: Uses `currentUser.name` as fallback for contractId

#### **2. Updated Download Function**
- ✅ **Flattened Structure Support**: Updated to work with flattened contract data
- ✅ **Consistent Data Access**: Same logic as getUserContractStatus function
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages when contract data missing
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging

#### **3. Applied Date Formatting Helper**
- ✅ **Helper Function Usage**: Updated contract status display to use `formatContractSignedDate()`
- ✅ **Consistent Formatting**: All date displays now use centralized helper
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when date parsing fails
- ✅ **Proper Date Display**: Signed dates show correctly instead of "Processing..."

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Updated getUserContractStatus for flattened structure
function getUserContractStatus(userEmail, jobId = null) {

## Phase 29 Fix - Data Source Architecture Clarification
**Date**: 2025-08-07
**Context**: Need to clarify which JSON files control which dropdown options and data

### Issues Identified
1. **Data Source Confusion**: Uncertainty about which JSON files control which dropdown options
2. **User vs Job Data Overlap**: Locations and project types used in both user profiles and job listings
3. **Centralization Questions**: Whether to centralize all dropdown options or keep them separate
4. **System Architecture**: Need to clarify the relationship between dropdown-options.json, users.json, and jobs-data.json

### Root Cause Analysis
**Data Architecture Questions**:
- **dropdown-options.json**: Contains roles, locations, rates, project types
- **users.json**: Stores user profiles with role, location, rate information
- **jobs-data.json**: Stores job listings with location, project type information
- **Overlap Concerns**: Locations and project types appear in both user and job data

**System Design Questions**:
- **Should dropdown-options.json control all dropdowns?**: Yes, for consistency
- **Should users.json and jobs-data.json reference dropdown-options.json?**: Yes, for data integrity
- **How to handle overlapping data?**: Centralized management with clear separation

### Solution Implemented
**Complete Data Source Architecture Clarification**:

#### **1. Clarified Data Source Responsibilities**
- ✅ **dropdown-options.json**: Centralized source for ALL dropdown options

  - Locations: Atlanta, LA, NYC, Miami, etc.
  - Rates: $50/hour, $100/hour, $200/hour, etc.
  - Project Types: Wedding, Commercial, Corporate Event, etc.

- ✅ **users.json**: Stores user profile data (references dropdown options)
  - User profiles with role, location, rate from dropdown-options.json
  - Contract information and job assignments
  - Performance reviews and payment information

- ✅ **jobs-data.json**: Stores job listings (references dropdown options)
  - Job listings with location, project type from dropdown-options.json
  - Job descriptions, dates, and status information

#### **2. Established Clear Data Flow**
```
dropdown-options.json (Master) 
    ↓ (provides options)
users.json (User Profiles) ←→ jobs-data.json (Job Listings)
    ↓ (uses options)
Admin Dashboard & User Portal
```

#### **3. Implemented Centralized Management**
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: dropdown-options.json controls all dropdown options
- ✅ **Consistent Data**: All systems use same options from centralized source
- ✅ **Easy Management**: Admin can modify options from one interface
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Prevents inconsistencies between user and job data

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Data source architecture clarification
const DATA_SOURCES = {
    // Master dropdown options - controls all dropdowns
    'dropdown-options.json': {
        purpose: 'Centralized dropdown options for entire system',
        controls: ['roles', 'locations', 'rates', 'projectTypes'],
        managed_by: 'Admin Dashboard Dropdown Management'
    },
    
    // User data - references dropdown options
    'users.json': {
        purpose: 'User profiles and contract information',
        references: 'dropdown-options.json for role, location, rate',
        structure: {
            users: {
                "userName": {
                    profile: {
                        role: "Photographer", // from dropdown-options.json
                        location: "Atlanta, GA", // from dropdown-options.json
                        rate: "$100/hour" // from dropdown-options.json
                    },
                    contract: { /* contract data */ },
                    jobs: { /* job assignments */ }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    
    // Job data - references dropdown options
    'jobs-data.json': {
        purpose: 'Job listings and project information',
        references: 'dropdown-options.json for location, projectType',
        structure: {
            jobs: [
                {
                    title: "Backdrop Photographer Base",
                    location: "Douglasville, GA", // from dropdown-options.json
                    projectType: "Event Coverage", // from dropdown-options.json
                    pay: "$400" // from dropdown-options.json
                }
            ]
        }
    }
};
```

## Phase 30 Fix - Role vs Project Type Clarification
**Date**: 2025-08-07
**Context**: Need to clarify the difference between "Roles" and "Project Types" and centralize management

### Issues Identified
1. **Role vs Project Type Confusion**: Uncertainty about the difference between user roles and project types
2. **User Creation Form**: Only shows "Role" field, missing "Project Type" field
3. **Data Structure Questions**: Whether project types should be part of user profiles or job assignments
4. **Management Centralization**: Need to clarify how roles and project types are managed

### Root Cause Analysis
**Conceptual Confusion**:
- **Roles**: User's professional role/career (Photographer, Videographer, Editor)
- **Project Types**: Types of projects they work on (Wedding, Commercial, Corporate Event)
- **Current Implementation**: User creation form only has "Role" field
- **Missing Field**: No "Project Type" field in user creation

**Data Structure Questions**:
- **Should project types be user-specific?**: No, project types are job-specific
- **Should roles be job-specific?**: No, roles are user-specific
- **How to manage this distinction?**: Clear separation in data structure

### Solution Implemented
**Complete Role vs Project Type Clarification**:

#### **1. Clarified Conceptual Differences**
- ✅ **Roles (User-Specific)**: Professional role/career of the user
  - Examples: Photographer, Videographer, Editor, Producer, Director
  - Stored in: users.json under user.profile.role
  - Managed in: Admin Dashboard → User Creation Form

- ✅ **Project Types (Job-Specific)**: Types of projects/jobs available
  - Examples: Wedding Photography, Corporate Event, Commercial Video, Product Photography
  - Stored in: jobs-data.json under job.projectType
  - Managed in: Admin Dashboard → Job Creation Form

#### **2. Updated User Creation Form**
- ✅ **Role Field**: Dropdown for user's professional role (Photographer, Videographer, etc.)
- ✅ **No Project Type Field**: Project types are job-specific, not user-specific
- ✅ **Clear Separation**: User roles vs job project types properly separated
- ✅ **Professional Interface**: Clean, focused user creation form

#### **3. Enhanced Job Creation Form**
- ✅ **Project Type Field**: Dropdown for job project type (Wedding, Commercial, etc.)
- ✅ **Location Field**: Dropdown for job location (Atlanta, LA, NYC, etc.)
- ✅ **Rate Field**: Dropdown for job pay rate ($50/hour, $100/hour, etc.)
- ✅ **Job-Specific Data**: All job-specific information properly organized

- **Date Format Issues**: Contract signed date format "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM" not being parsed correctly
- **Unused Fields**: `contractUploadedDate` field no longer needed but still present in data structure

**Date Display Problems**:
- **Date Parsing**: The specific date format "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM" wasn't being parsed correctly
- **Fallback Logic**: When date parsing failed, system showed "Processing..." instead of actual date

### Solution Implemented
**Complete PDF Download & Date Display Fix**:

#### **1. Fixed PDF Download Status Check**
- ✅ **Allow Multiple Statuses**: Changed from `!== 'signed'` to `!== 'signed' && !== 'uploaded'`
- ✅ **Support Both Statuses**: Both 'signed' and 'uploaded' contracts can now be downloaded
- ✅ **Maintain Security**: Still blocks downloads for 'pending' or invalid statuses

#### **2. Enhanced Date Parsing**
- ✅ **Specific Format Support**: Updated `formatContractSignedDate` to handle "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM" format
- ✅ **Robust Parsing**: Split date string and parse date/time parts separately
- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: Display original date string if parsing fails
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for debugging

#### **3. Cleaned Up Data Structure**
- ✅ **Removed Unused Field**: Eliminated `contractUploadedDate` from users.json
- ✅ **Simplified Structure**: Cleaner contract data structure
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion**: No more unused fields causing display issues

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Fixed PDF download status check
if (userContract.contractStatus !== 'signed' && userContract.contractStatus !== 'uploaded') {
    console.log('❌ Contract not signed yet');
    showNotification('❌ Your contract has not been signed yet. Please wait for admin approval.', 'error');
    return;
}

// Enhanced date parsing for specific format
function formatContractSignedDate(dateString) {
    if (!dateString) return 'Processing...';
    
    try {
        // Handle the specific format "8/6/2025, 5:23:17 AM"
        let date;
        if (dateString.includes(',')) {
            // Parse the specific format
            const parts = dateString.split(',');
            const datePart = parts[0].trim();
            const timePart = parts[1].trim();
            date = new Date(`${datePart} ${timePart}`);
        } else {
            date = new Date(dateString);
        }
        
        if (!isNaN(date.getTime())) {
            return date.toLocaleDateString();
        } else {
            return dateString; // Display as is
        }
    } catch (error) {
        return dateString; // Display as is
    }
}
```

### Results Achieved
- ✅ **PDF Downloads Working**: Both 'signed' and 'uploaded' contracts can be downloaded
- ✅ **Correct Date Display**: Contract signed dates now show actual dates instead of "Processing..."
- ✅ **Clean Data Structure**: Removed unused `contractUploadedDate` field
- ✅ **Better User Experience**: Users can now download their contracts successfully
- ✅ **Robust Date Handling**: System handles various date formats gracefully
- ✅ **No More Confusion**: Eliminated unused fields that were causing display issues

### Technical Benefits

## Phase 10 Fix - [Next Phase]
```

## Phase 3 Fix - GitHub Push Issue on User Deletion
**Issue**: When deleting users (both active and archived) from the admin dashboard, changes were not being pushed to GitHub, causing data loss and inconsistency.

**Root Cause**: 
1. **Duplicate deleteUser functions** - Two different `deleteUser` functions were defined, causing conflicts
2. **Wrong API endpoint** - The function was calling `/api/github/file/users.json` instead of the more reliable `/api/update-users`
3. **Missing environment variable** - `GITHUB_BRANCH` was not set, causing GitHub API calls to fail
4. **Poor error handling** - No detailed logging or user feedback when deletions failed

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Unified deleteUser Function**: Removed duplicate function and created single, robust implementation
2. **API Endpoint Fix**: Changed from GitHub file API to `/api/update-users` for better reliability
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set `GITHUB_BRANCH=main` environment variable
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive logging, loading states, and user feedback
5. **Improved Workflow**: Better PDF cleanup, Firebase deletion, and data persistence flow

**Files Modified**:
- `admin-dashboard.html`: Fixed deleteUser function and removed duplicates
- `test-admin-deletion-github-fix.js`: New diagnostic script to identify GitHub push issues
- `test-user-deletion-fix.js`: New verification script to test the fix

**Test Results**:
- ✅ User deletion now properly persists to users.json
- ✅ Changes are successfully pushed to GitHub via /api/update-users
- ✅ Comprehensive logging shows exactly what's happening during deletion
- ✅ Better error handling prevents silent failures
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured for GitHub API

**Key Changes Made**:
```javascript
// OLD (Problematic)
async function deleteUser(name, isArchived = false) {
    // ... deletion logic ...
    await updateUsersOnGitHub('hard-delete', name); // GitHub file API
}

// NEW (Fixed)
async function deleteUser(userName, isArchived = false) {
    // ... enhanced deletion logic ...
    const updateResponse = await fetch('/api/update-users', { // More reliable API
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
            users: window.users,
            action: 'hard-delete',
            userName: userName
        })
    });
}
```

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token
- `GITHUB_OWNER`: Repository owner (cochranfilms)
- `GITHUB_REPO`: Repository name (cochran-job-listings)
- `GITHUB_BRANCH`: Branch name (main) - **This was missing and causing failures**

**Result**: User deletions now properly persist to both local storage and GitHub, with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ---

## Equipment & Resource Center (Phased Implementation)

Date: 2025-01-10

Overview: Introduced a full Equipment & Resource Center across the Creator Portal and Admin Dashboard, implemented in three phases.

Phase 1 – Data layer + User Portal UI
- Added Firestore collections: `equipment`, `resources`, `equipmentRequests`, `maintenance`.
- Extended `firestore-data-manager.js` with CRUD methods and realtime listeners for the new collections.
- Added `equipment-section` to `user-portal.html` with tabs:
  - Gear Library (browse, filter, request)
  - Resource Downloads (brand guidelines, templates, style guides)
  - Equipment Requests (submit/view own requests)
  - Maintenance Tracking (read-only view)

Phase 2 – Admin Dashboard management UI
- Added four cards to `admin-dashboard.html`:
  - Equipment Inventory: add/edit/delete equipment.
  - Resource Downloads: add/delete resources with URL/version.
  - Equipment Requests: list and approve/deny.
  - Maintenance: schedule/update/delete maintenance items.

Phase 3 – Workflow automation
- Approval workflow reserves equipment for request dates; detects conflicts.
- Added check-out/check-in actions to inventory; returns gear to available and clears reservation.
- Requests update status: `approved`, `denied`, or `conflict` (with details).

Files touched
- `firestore-data-manager.js`: collections, listeners, CRUD for equipment/resources/requests/maintenance.
- `user-portal.html`: new Equipment Center nav + section and render/submit logic.
- `admin-dashboard.html`: admin UI for inventory/resources/requests/maintenance and workflow actions.

Notes
- All admin actions leverage existing Firebase initialization and notification UI.
- Realtime listeners emit `firestore:dataChange` events for future live UI updates.

## Phase 0–2 (Sept 15, 2025) — Auth UX, Identity Persistence, Jobs Timeline

- Phase 0 — Auth hygiene
  - Fixed Firebase bucket to `cochran-films.appspot.com`; corrected `bucketURL`.
  - Login: added `auth/invalid-credential` mapping and a built‑in Forgot password reset.
- Phase 1 — Identity persistence
  - Contract signing writes `profile.name` to user doc; caches recent signature name/email.
  - First-login backfill writes `profile.name` if missing using cached signature, then refreshes.
  - Portal prefers `profile.name` for greetings.
- Phase 2 — Current Jobs redesign
  - Replaced vertical timeline with horizontal stepper; compact header button group (Details / Download / Message).
  - Buttons no longer stretch vertically; improved mobile stacking.

Acceptance
- Wrong password surfaces clear message; reset works.
- After contract sign or first login, greeting shows the user's real name.
- Current Jobs timeline is concise, with smooth states and compact controls.
