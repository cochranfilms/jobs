## Messaging Board vs. Chat System

This release namespaces the community "Team Messaging" board helpers to avoid collisions with the direct-messaging chat subsystem.

- Community board functions are now: `communityLoadMessages`, `communityDisplayMessages`, `communitySendMessage`, `communitySaveMessages`.
- The chat subsystem continues to use `MessagingService` methods and its own `loadMessages(conversationId)` UI handler.
- Guards were added so the chat subsystem lazily initializes `messagingService` before `loadMessages`, `selectConversation`, and `sendMessage`.

### How to test
1. Open `user-portal.html`, sign in.
2. Switch to Community section; post a message using the board input. Expect no console errors.
3. Switch to Messaging section; start a conversation with Admin; send a message. Expect no null derefs.
4. Verify analytics loads; console should not show `generateBusinessIntelligenceInsights is not defined`.

Automated: run `comprehensive-notification-test.js` and `messaging-test.js` to smoke the messaging service. Both should pass without TypeErrors.
## Jan 2025 — Messaging System Implementation

### 2025-01-XX — Real-time Messaging System

- Files: `user-portal.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `messaging-service.js`, `firestore.rules`
- Changes:
  - Added comprehensive messaging system with real-time Firebase integration
  - Created `directMessages` Firestore collection with conversation and message subcollections
  - Implemented file attachment support with Firebase Storage
  - Added read receipts and message status tracking
  - Created admin messaging interface with user management capabilities
  - Added security rules for conversation access control
  - Implemented search functionality for messages
  - Added responsive design for mobile compatibility

- Test:
  1. Open `user-portal.html` and sign in as a regular user
  2. Navigate to Messages section and start a new conversation with admin
  3. Send messages with text and file attachments
  4. Open `admin-dashboard.html` and sign in as admin
  5. Verify admin can see all conversations and respond to users
  6. Test real-time message updates between user and admin
  7. Verify file attachments upload and display correctly
  8. Test read receipts and message status indicators
  9. Run `messaging-test.js` for comprehensive automated testing

### 2025-09-13 — Admin Broadcast + Search Enhancements

- Files: `admin-dashboard.html`, `messaging-service.js`, `firestore-data-manager.js`
- Changes:
  - Implemented admin broadcast sending to each non-admin user by creating/using a direct conversation and posting a message.
  - Wired admin search to `MessagingService.searchMessages(query, conversationId)` for scoped results with in-chat scroll to last match.
  - Added lightweight image modal `adminOpenImageModal(url)` for attachments.
- Test:
  1. Admin: open Messaging, click megaphone → enter a test broadcast.
  2. Observe toast showing recipient count; verify user(s) see the message live in `user-portal.html`.
  3. Open a conversation, click search icon, enter a term from recent messages → verify scroll and count.
  4. Send an image; click the image in admin chat → modal opens; click outside/✕ to close.

- Database Schema:
  - `directMessages/{conversationId}`: Conversation metadata
  - `directMessages/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}`: Individual messages
  - `messageAttachments/{conversationId}/{messageId}/{fileName}`: File attachments

## Sept 2025 — Jobs/Applications sync fixes

- Public `index.html` continues to use Apply link only; Quick Apply is limited to `user-portal.html` job cards.
- Admin approval path now stores `rate` on the assigned job in the user record (and mirrors to `pay` for backward compatibility). Acceptance emails derive rate from the specific approved job (Quick Apply passes `jobKey`).
- Add New Job form placeholders restored: "Select Location…", "Select Rate…", and "Select Project Type…". `jobType` is populated from Firestore `dropdownOptions.projectTypes`.
- When approving Quick Apply applicants, the system attempts to create a Firebase Auth account for the applicant if one doesn't already exist so they can sign in to the portal.
  - Guard added: server `GET /api/firebase?email=...` checks existence; creation only runs if not found.

How to test quickly (old script workflow):
1) In Admin Dashboard, add a job selecting values from the dropdowns; verify placeholders appear when empty.
2) From User Portal, use Quick Apply on a priority job. Approve that Quick Apply item in Admin Dashboard.
3) Verify the acceptance email/contract references the specific job you just approved (not an older job), with the correct rate.
4) Attempt login with the approved email; access should be granted.
### 2025-09-16 — Contract Password Set via Admin API

- Files: `api/firebase.js`, `contract.html`
- Change:
  - Added secure Admin SDK path in `api/firebase.js` to set passwords without requiring the old password. Endpoint: `PUT /api/firebase { email, newPassword, admin:true }`.
  - `contract.html` now prefers this server endpoint when setting the portal password after signing. If Admin credentials are not configured, it falls back to client-side update when the user is already signed in, or finally sends a password reset email.
- Test (old automatic testing system):
  1. In Admin, approve an application so a Firebase Auth user may already exist.
  2. Open `contract.html`, sign the contract, set a new password (≥6 chars).
  3. Expect success with no "password not saved" message. Console should show `admin: true` in the response when Admin credentials are configured.
  4. Try logging into `user-portal.html` with the new password.

Notes:
- Server requires `firebase-admin` env vars: `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (\n escaped). If missing, endpoint gracefully falls back to REST behavior requiring `oldPassword`.

### 2025-09-12 — Contract System: Firestore Storage Integration

- Files: `contract.html`, `user-portal.html`
- Change: All contract PDFs now upload to Firestore Storage organized by user email in `contracts/{email}/` folders instead of GitHub. Download buttons prioritize Firestore Storage URLs over GitHub URLs. Contract signing process uses `uploadPDFToFirestoreStorage()` instead of `uploadPDFToGitHub()`.
- Test:
  1. Sign a new contract via `contract.html` or quick apply in `user-portal.html`.
  2. Verify PDF uploads to Firestore Storage at `contracts/{email}/{filename}`.
  3. Check that download buttons in user portal use Firestore Storage URLs.
  4. Verify email notifications contain Firestore Storage download links.
  5. Legacy GitHub URLs should still work as fallbacks for existing contracts.

### 2025-09-12 — User Portal: Multi-job timelines and all-contracts listing

### 2025-09-12 — User Portal: Job Prioritization and Tabbed Interface

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Changes: 
  - Fixed `getSelectedJob()` to prioritize most recent upcoming job instead of `primaryJob` or first job
  - Added tabbed interface with "Current & Upcoming" and "All Jobs" tabs
  - Enhanced job display logic to show strategic job prioritization
  - Added CSS styles for new tab buttons matching existing design system
- Test:
  1. Ensure a user has multiple jobs with different dates (some upcoming, some completed)
  2. Open `user-portal.html` and sign in as that user
  3. Verify "Current & Upcoming" tab shows the most recent upcoming job as primary
  4. Verify "All Jobs" tab shows all jobs with proper status indicators
  5. Test tab switching functionality works smoothly
  6. Verify job prioritization logic correctly identifies upcoming vs completed jobs
### 2025-09-13 — Community Likes fix (comments + showcases)
- ### 2025-09-14 — Community Messageboard visibility + input wiring fix

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change:
  - Unhid the Community → Team Messaging card (removed inline `style="display: none;"`).
  - Aligned input `id` from `teamMessageInput` to `messageInput` so `initializeMessagingBoard()` binds Enter-to-send.
  - Enabled the send button to call `sendMessage()` instead of a no-op.
- Why: The messageboard was missing due to the card being hidden and handlers not bound because of the wrong input id.
- Test (old script workflow):
  1) Open `user-portal.html`, sign in, click Community.
  2) In Team Messaging, type a test message and press Enter → message appears.
  3) Click the paper plane → message sends; toast "Message sent!".
  4) In Firebase Console → Firestore `messages`, verify a new doc with `author`, `authorEmail`, `text`, `timestamp`.
  5) Like a message → `likes` increments and `likedBy` includes your email.
  6) Open a second browser as another user; verify real-time updates without refresh.


- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Fix: Quote string IDs in inline handlers and harden like functions.
  - Buttons now call `toggleMessageLike('<id>')` and `toggleLike('<id>')`.
  - Functions compare via `String(id)` and coerce counts with `Number(...)`.
- Why: Unquoted IDs created global references like `atMnDSBK6Z6YpF0Cdlf8` which caused `ReferenceError` on click.
- Persistence + notifications test (browser):
  1. Open `user-portal.html` and sign in as User A; go to Community → Team Messaging. Like a message authored by User B.
  2. In Firebase Console → Firestore, check `messages/<id>.likes` increases and `likedBy` includes User A's email.
  3. Sign in as User B in another browser; verify a new document under `notifications` appears with `toEmail=User B` and title "New like on your message".
  4. In Community → Success Stories, like a showcase; verify `showcases/<id>.likes` increases and a notification is created for the author.
  5. Refresh both pages; like counts should persist from Firestore.


- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change: Jobs tab now renders all job timelines for the signed-in user using `displayCurrentJobs()` (instead of single-selection timeline). Contracts tab now lists all uploaded contracts for the user's email using `displayContracts()`. Each contract's Download now calls `downloadContractById(contractId, fileName?, githubUrl?, fileUrl?)` to ensure the correct PDF is served.
- Test:
  1. Ensure a user has 2+ entries under `users/<uid>.jobs` and at least 2 contract docs in Firestore `contracts` with `freelancerEmail` equal to the user email.
  2. Open `user-portal.html` and sign in as that user.
  3. Jobs tab should show a `.job-card` for each job, each with its own "Project Timeline".
  4. Contracts tab should show multiple `.contract-card` entries, newest first. Click Download on each; verify the correct corresponding PDF downloads for each card (mismatches would indicate bad contractId wiring).

### 2025-09-12 — Quick Apply Flow (Portal → Admin Queue)

- Files: `user-portal.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `firestore-data-manager.js`
- Change:
  - Priority Jobs "Quick Apply" now writes to `quickApplications` via `FirestoreDataManager.addQuickApplication()` with duplicate prevention (email+job guarded).
  - Admin dashboard merges `applications` + `quickApplications` into one queue with source tags; Approve/Deny supports both via `setQuickApplicationStatus()` or `setApplicationStatus()`.
  - On Approve, we attach job to user (duplicate-guarded), persist to Firestore, and call existing `sendJobAcceptanceEmail` to kick off EmailJS → Contract → Portal flow (same as `apply.html`).
  - Mirrors: `users/{uid}/quickApplications/*` and `jobs/{jobId}/quickApplications/*` for quick applies.

Old automatic testing system steps:
1) Prep: In Firebase Console, ensure at least one job exists in `jobs` with fields: `title`, optional `date`, `location`, `pay`.
2) User portal: Open `user-portal.html`, sign in as a test user; go to Priority Jobs and click "Quick Apply". Expect toast "Application sent! Admin will review shortly." and no JS errors. If Firestore unavailable, a prefilled `/apply.html` opens instead.
3) Admin: Open `admin-dashboard.html` → Application Management. Verify counters update and the application appears with email + date, with Approve and Deny buttons.
4) Click Approve. Expect toast "Application approved"; status pill turns accepted; counters update. Click Deny on another app and verify status transitions.
5) Refresh both pages; ensure states persist. In Firestore, confirm a doc in `applications`, and mirrors under `users/{uid}/applications/{appId}` and `jobs/{jobId}/applications/{appId}`.

Notes:
- Duplicate prevention: submitting Quick Apply again for the same job/email within 24h returns the existing application id rather than creating a new doc.
- Fallback: If Firestore is not available, Quick Apply opens `/apply.html` with prefilled query params; no data loss, but admin queue won't reflect until manual submission.

### 2025-08-20 — Project Start Date Source & Current Jobs Status

- Scope: `user-portal.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`
- Change: Current Jobs status and timeline now compute from the job's start date (`jobs[*].projectStart|date`) instead of any contract signed date or profile date. Admin assigning a job sets `job.projectStart` from the job listing's `date` rather than `profile.projectDate`.
- Expected: Before start date → status "upcoming"; on/after start date → "in-progress"; timeline remains consistent.

Test steps:
1. Create two jobs in data: one with a future `date`, one with a past `date`. Assign each to a test user.
2. Open `user-portal.html` and switch between jobs if multiple; verify:
   - "Start Date" displays the job's `date`.
   - Status badge shows "upcoming" for the future job, "in-progress" for the past job.
   - Timeline current step aligns with status (scheduled vs in progress).
3. From `admin-dashboard.html`, add a user and attach a job; confirm the saved `job.projectStart` equals the attached job's `date`.
### Duplicate Firestore Users prevention (2025-08-19)
### Landing Jobs Visibility Hotfix (2025-08-20)

### User Portal Auth Session Unification (2025-08-20)

What changed:
- `user-portal.html` no longer initializes a separate named Firebase app (`'user-portal'`). It now waits for the existing app via `FirebaseConfig.waitForInit()` and reuses `FirebaseConfig.auth` and Firestore. This prevents a mismatch where users are signed into Firebase Auth but the portal UI doesn't see the session.

How to verify quickly:
1. Sign in or create an account so you appear in Firebase Auth.
2. Open `/user-portal.html`; watch the console for:
   - "✅ Firebase initialized in user portal"
   - "✅ User authenticated: <email>"
3. Confirm the login screen hides and the portal shows without needing to re-enter credentials.
4. Reload the page; the session should persist and the portal should render directly.

Edge case handled:
- If a login is attempted before Firebase finishes initializing, the UI now waits and rehydrates `auth` via `FirebaseConfig.waitForInit()`; users will see a friendly "Initializing secure sign-in..." message rather than a JS error.

What changed:
- In `index.html`, the job filtering step now derives a title from multiple fields (`title`, `Title`, `jobTitle`, `position`, `Job Title`, `Applying For Which Job`, `applying_for_which_job`) before deciding inclusion. This prevents valid Firestore job docs that use alternate field names from being filtered out.

How to verify quickly:
1. Open `index.html` with DevTools Console visible.
2. Ensure Firebase initializes (look for "✅ Firebase initialized in index.html").
3. Check the console for rows logged as "Row with title ..." and confirm jobs render below without the empty-state banner.
4. Click "Refresh Jobs" and confirm listings persist and update without showing the "not hiring" message unless there truly are zero jobs in Firestore.

### Admin Dashboard: Quick Actions removed (2025-08-19)

### Equipment & Resource Center Testing (2025-01-10)

Scope: `user-portal.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `firestore-data-manager.js`

Automated test script suggestion: integrate into `phase3-comprehensive-test.js`.

Test matrix:
1) Equipment CRUD (Admin)
   - Add equipment with name, category, serial, tags.
   - Update status; delete item. Verify realtime list updates.
2) Resources CRUD (Admin)
   - Add resource (title, type, url, version). Open link. Delete.
3) Requests workflow (User → Admin)
   - As a user, submit request with items and date range.
   - As admin, approve request → equipment reserves; deny request → status `denied`.
   - Conflict: create overlapping reservation and approve; request should become `conflict` with details.
4) Check-out / Check-in
   - After approval, check-out reserved item; status → `checked_out`.
   - Check-in → status → `available`, reservation cleared.

Browser steps (old automatic testing system):
1. Open `admin-dashboard.html`, sign in. Add a test equipment item and a resource.
2. Open `user-portal.html`, sign in as a test user. Go to Equipment Center → Requests. Submit a request for the test item with a date range.
3. Back in admin: open Equipment Requests and click Approve. Confirm inventory shows the item as reserved with reservation details.
4. Click Check Out on the item; then Check In. Confirm states transition and reservation clears.
5. Create a second request overlapping the same dates and approve; confirm conflict state on the request and that the original reservation remains intact.

Expected logs:
- Admin console: load messages for equipment/resources/requests/maintenance; action confirmations on save/update/delete.
- User console: initializeEquipmentCenter success and render counts.
What changed:
- Removed the legacy Quick Actions UI and functions from `admin-dashboard.html`:
  - Buttons: Generate All Contracts, Export Users, Download Users, Download Contracts, Force Refresh Users, Migrate to Firestore, Full Migration, Verify Migration.
  - Functions removed: `generateAllContracts`, `exportUsersData`, `downloadUsersJSON`, `downloadContractFiles`, `forceRefreshUsers`, `migrateToFirestore`, `runFullMigration`, `verifyMigration`.
  - Dropped the page include for `migrate-to-firestore.js` (no longer referenced).

### 2025-09-12 — Equipment Center tab visibility and refresh fix

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change: `switchEquipmentTab(tabName)` now correctly adds/removes the `active` class on tab content and sets inline `display` to ensure tabs render. Also triggers `loadEquipmentRequests()` when opening Requests and `loadRentedEquipment()` when opening Rented.
- Reason: Previously, switching tabs only toggled `style.display` without the `active` class; because `.performance-tab-content { display:none }`, some tabs stayed hidden, showing a blank area.

Quick test (browser):
1. Sign in to `user-portal.html` and go to Equipment & Resource Center.
2. Click "Equipment Requests" → form and "Your Requests" list should appear. Submit a test request and see it render in "Your Requests".
3. From `admin-dashboard.html`, approve the request (Row 4 → Requests). Ensure at least one item is checked out.
4. Back in `user-portal.html`, click "My Rented Equipment" → the checked‑out item(s) render with rental details. No empty state if items exist.

Console expectations:
- On switching to Requests: logs "🔄 Loading equipment requests …" then "✅ Loaded equipment requests …" and "✅ Equipment requests rendered successfully".
- On switching to Rented: logs "🔄 Loading rented equipment …" then "✅ Loaded rented equipment …" and "✅ Rented equipment rendered successfully".

### 2025-09-12 — Team Messaging: remove standalone "New Message" button

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change: Removed the extra "New Message" button from the Team Messaging card header. The messaging workflow now uses only the inline composer at the bottom of the card.
- Reason: Avoid duplicate entry points; composer already supports starting new threads/replies.

How to verify quickly:
1. Open `user-portal.html` → Community → Team Messaging.
2. Confirm the card header shows only the title and no button in the right side.
3. Type a message in the bottom composer and send; message posts successfully and appears in the list.

### 2025-09-12 — Equipment Requests: remove manual form

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change: The Equipment Requests tab no longer shows a manual form. Users initiate requests from the Gear Library "Request" button; the Requests tab now shows instructions plus "Your Requests".
- Reason: Single, clear entry point and avoids duplicate UX.

Quick test:
1. Open `user-portal.html` → Equipment & Resource Center.
2. In Gear Library, click "Request" on an available item; dates modal/flow creates a request.
3. Switch to Equipment Requests tab; the new request appears in the list. No form is present.

### 2025-09-12 — Success Stories now Firestore-backed (live data)

- Files: `user-portal.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `firestore-data-manager.js`
- Change: The Success Stories grid in the portal now loads from Firestore collection `successStories` via `FirestoreDataManager.getSuccessStories()` and listens for real-time updates through the shared data-change event. Admin dashboard counts also prefer Firestore with localStorage fallback.
- Reason: Replace sample/localStorage data with live, centralized data like other collections.

Quick test (browser):
1. In Firebase Console, create a doc under `successStories` with fields like `author`, `authorEmail`, `role`, `achievement`, `title`, `description`, `stats { projectsCompleted, clientRating, earnings }`, `timestamp`.
2. Open `user-portal.html` → Community → Success Stories. Verify the new story appears without refresh and respects the achievement filter.
3. Open `admin-dashboard.html` and check the "Success Stories" mini-stat increments accordingly.
4. Delete or edit the story in Firestore; verify the portal grid updates live.

### 2025-09-12 — Community Tools modernization (Admin)

- Files: `admin-dashboard.html`, `firestore-data-manager.js`
- Change: Replaced prompt-based flows for Events and Success Stories with modern modals.
  - Event Manager: create/edit/delete/status in a modal UI.
  - Success Story Manager: create/edit/delete with stats fields (projects, rating, earnings).
  - Buttons `Create Event`/`Manage Events` and `Add Success Story`/`Manage Success Stories` open the modals.
  - Validation: Title and Date required; inline toasts on success/failure.
- Mini-stat counters still pull from Firestore with localStorage fallback.

Quick test:
1. Open `admin-dashboard.html` → Community Management.
2. Click Create Event or Manage Events; the Event Manager modal appears. Create a new event (Title + Date required). Verify it appears and counters update.
3. Click Add Success Story or Manage Success Stories; the Success Story Manager modal appears. Create/edit/delete stories and verify counters update.
4. Check `user-portal.html` Community tabs; counts reflect changes live.

### 2025-09-12 — Calendar Events Firestore Integration

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change: Events calendar now loads from Firestore instead of localStorage with sample data.
  - `loadEvents()` function updated to use `FirestoreDataManager.getEvents()`.
  - Events are mapped to calendar format (title, description, date, type, location).
  - Removed localStorage fallback and sample data generation.
  - Calendar initialization is now async with `ensureFirestoreReady()` guard.
- Events display in calendar grid and events list with real-time updates.

Quick test:
1. Open `admin-dashboard.html` → Community Management → Create Event. Add a test event with title and date.
2. Open `user-portal.html` → Events & Calendar tab.
3. Verify the calendar shows the new event on the correct date.
4. Check events list displays the event with proper details.
5. Console should show "✅ Loaded events from Firestore: X" where X is the count.

### 2025-09-12 — Equipment Requests: available-gear multi-select

- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Change: Replaced free-text items input with a multi-select dropdown populated from Firestore `equipment` where `status === 'available'`. Prefill from Gear Library now selects the item in the dropdown. Submissions read selected options instead of comma text.

How to test:
1. Ensure at least one equipment document has `status: 'available'` (and at least one set to `checked_out` for contrast).
2. Open `user-portal.html` → Equipment → Equipment Requests.
3. Verify the Items control shows a multi-select list of only available gear; names are alphabetized and may include serial numbers.
4. Hold Cmd/Ctrl to select multiple; submit the request.
5. In Admin → Requests, approve. Switch back to portal → Rented tab should show the approved items after approval.
6. From Gear Library, click "Request" on an available item → the Requests tab opens with that item pre-selected.

Verification steps:
1. Open `admin-dashboard.html` and sign in.
2. In the User & Contract Management card, confirm there is no "Quick Actions" section and no related buttons.
3. Open DevTools Console and run any removed function name (e.g., `generateAllContracts`) and confirm `undefined` errors are not present because nothing binds them to UI; no references remain on the page.

### 2025-09-12 — Social Flyer: OBS Technical Assistant

- Files: `OBS-Technical-Assistant-Flyer.html`
- Purpose: A social-ready flyer to recruit an on-site OBS Technical Assistant using Cochran Films branding.

Quick test (manual browser):
1. Open `/OBS-Technical-Assistant-Flyer.html` in a desktop browser.
2. Verify visuals:
   - Cochran Films logo renders crisply with gold glow.
   - Title shows "OBS Technical Assistant".
   - When/times: 9/15 & 9/16; 10:30–1:30 (9/15) and 4:30–9:30 (9/16).
3. Click "Download as PNG". Expect `OBS-Tech-Assistant-Flyer-<timestamp>.png` to download. If blocked, take a screenshot of the card at 1080×1350.
4. Resize to mobile (~390px). Layout stacks cleanly; no clipping or overflow.


### 2025-08-20 — Prevent stuck global loading overlay in admin dashboard

- Files: `admin-dashboard-modular/js/utils/loading-manager.js`, `admin-dashboard-modular/js/app.js`, `admin-dashboard.html`
- Change: When the main dashboard controls the UI (`window.MAIN_DASHBOARD_LOADING_OVERRIDE === false`), the modular LoadingManager and modular App will not show the global `#loadingIndicator`. This avoids a race where the indicator could be shown by modular code and never hidden by the main dashboard, leaving the page in a constant loading state.

How to test quickly:
1. Open `admin-dashboard.html` on a fresh tab with DevTools Console visible.
2. Ensure console shows: "✅ Main dashboard ADMIN_PASSWORD set:" and then "✅ Firebase initialized in admin dashboard".
3. Verify the login screen appears (or the dashboard if session active) and the fullscreen Loading overlay does not persist.
4. Wait ~2 seconds for the modular system to load; the overlay should still not stick.
5. Stress test: call `window.LoadingManager.showGlobalLoading()` then after 35s confirm the safety timer auto-hides it; or call `window.LoadingManager.emergencyClear()` to force-hide.


Goal: Stop creation of two docs (e.g., `Cody Cochran` and `Codylcochran87`) for the same person.

What changed:
- `firestore-data-manager.js` now exposes `findUserIdByEmail(email)` and normalizes email to lowercase on write.
- `setUser()` remaps the incoming `userId` to an existing doc id when one with the same email already exists.
- `user-portal.html` auto-provision now calls `findUserIdByEmail()` and uses the existing id if present.
- `admin-dashboard.html` save/edit paths also resolve by email before calling `setUser()`.

How to test quickly:
1. In Admin → Add New User, enter an email that already exists under a different name and click Save. Verify only one doc remains in Firestore (the existing id is updated; no new doc is created).
2. In `apply.html`, submit with the same email multiple times using different name variants. Verify Firestore keeps a single doc keyed by the first id but updated with latest fields.
3. In `user-portal.html`, sign in with an email not in Firestore; the portal should create exactly one doc. Sign out/in again; still one doc.

### Start Date Resolution & PDF Verification (2025-08-19)

Purpose: Ensure the project start date no longer shows as "TBD" in the portal and PDFs when a valid date exists.

Scope:
- `user-portal.html`: UI now uses a centralized `getEffectiveProjectStartDate()` with fallbacks and `formatDisplayDate()` for rendering.
- `contract.html`: PDF data uses expanded fallbacks for `projectStart`.

How to test (automated/browser):
1. Open `user-portal.html` with a user having any of these populated: `jobs[primary].projectStart`, `jobs[primary].date`, `profile.projectDate`, or `application.eventDate`.
2. Confirm the Job card and Job Details modal show the formatted date (not "TBD").
3. Sign a contract on `contract.html` (or use preview button) and download the PDF.
4. In the PDF header "PROJECT DETAILS", the `Start:` line should display the resolved date, not "TBD".
5. Regression: If none of the sources are set, "TBD" is expected.

Notes:
- Date parsing is display-only; we do not mutate stored values.
- If schemas change, update `getEffectiveProjectStartDate()` to include new sources.

## Firestore Single Source of Truth Integration (Apply + Contract)
### Performance quick wins (2025-08-19)

Scope:
- `user-portal.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `index.html`

Changes:
- Added Google Fonts `preconnect` to `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` to speed up font loads.
- Marked all third-party and local scripts as `defer` to avoid render blocking.
- Removed unused `html2canvas` on `user-portal.html` and `admin-dashboard.html` (not referenced in code paths).
- Marked logos with explicit `width`/`height`, `decoding="async"`, and `loading="lazy"` where non-critical.
- Set `fetchpriority="high"` for the primary hero logo in `index.html`.

Verification steps:
1. Open DevTools → Performance → reload `index.html`; First Contentful Paint should improve and main thread idle during HTML parse.
2. Network tab: verify `html2canvas.min.js` does not load on `user-portal.html` or `admin-dashboard.html`.
3. Network tab waterfalls: Firebase and local scripts should be `Parser` initiated with `defer` and start downloading earlier but execute after parse.
4. Check layout stability (CLS): images should no longer cause layout shift thanks to width/height on logos.

Regression considerations:
- `defer` preserves script execution order but runs after parse; if any inline code relied on immediate execution before DOMContentLoaded, verify those blocks still work. All Firebase init paths already run on `DOMContentLoaded`.

### Landing Password Gate (2025-08-19)

- Added an AI-themed, password-protected modal to `index.html` that appears on first visit per session.
- Purpose: Inform users the page is in development, provide a CTA to the current landing site, and allow admin access via a password without blocking the page globally.

Details:
- Modal class names: `.ai-gate-modal`, `.ai-gate-panel` (styles inline in `index.html`).
- CTA: "Visit Current Landing Page" → `https://landing.cochranfilms.com` (opens in new tab).
- Admin "Enter" shows a password row; unlocking hides the modal for the session.
- Password (current): `USER1234`. Change by editing the comparison in the `tryUnlock()` function.
- Session key used: `cf_index_gate_unlocked_v1`.

Quick test:
1. Open `index.html`. Verify the modal appears and body scroll is disabled.
2. Click "Visit Current Landing Page" → confirm new tab opens to landing site.
3. Click "Enter" → password input appears.
4. Enter wrong password → error flashes; modal remains.
5. Enter `USER1234` → modal closes; page usable; session persists until tab close.
6. Reload page in same tab/session → modal does not reappear.
7. Open in a new tab or after clearing sessionStorage → modal reappears.

Notes:
- The gate is visual only; underlying page loads normally once unlocked.
- Uses the same AI/glass aesthetic as `popup.html` to maintain branding continuity.


- apply.html now initializes Firebase/Firestore via `firebase-config.js` and writes applications to the `users` collection using `FirestoreDataManager.setUser(name, {...})`. It still performs a best-effort backup to `/api/apply` to keep GitHub JSON in sync, but Firestore is primary.
- contract.html now loads users primarily from Firestore (`FirestoreDataManager.getUsers()`), falling back to `/api/users` only if Firestore is unavailable. When a contract is signed, it:
  - Updates the user's `contract` metadata in Firestore (`contractStatus`, `contractSignedDate`, optional `fileUrl` if uploaded), then updates users.json via the existing GitHub API as a backup.
  - Mirrors the signed contract into the `contracts` collection with `FirestoreDataManager.setContract(id, data)`.
  - Existing EmailJS flows are unchanged, but now assume Firestore holds the canonical user/job state.
  - Deletion flow: From `admin-dashboard.html` you can now delete a contract directly. This removes the Firestore `contracts/<id>` doc, clears the user's `contract` field, and calls `/api/delete-pdf` to remove the PDF (local/GitHub best-effort).
  - Auto-migration is disabled by default. To re-seed Firestore from backups intentionally, set `window.FIRESTORE_AUTO_MIGRATION = true;` before loading the dashboard, then refresh.

Smoke tests:
- Apply Flow: Open `/apply.html`, submit a new application, verify a new doc appears in Firestore `users` with `application.status=pending`, and the user appears in `admin-dashboard.html` pending list. Approve from admin; verify EmailJS fired and Firestore user updated to `application.status=approved` with `profile.approvedDate`.
- Contract Flow: In `/contract.html`, access with the approved user. Sign contract; verify Firestore `users/<name>.contract.contractStatus` updates to `signed` or `uploaded` and `contracts/<contractId>` exists. Verify backup JSON also updated.
Test/Debug Cleanup Policy

- The repository includes historical test and debug artifacts. Use the cleanup utility to keep production HTMLs clean (`admin-dashboard.html`, `user-portal.html`).

Commands

```bash
# dry-run
npm run cleanup-tests

# list
npm run cleanup-tests:list

# apply
npm run cleanup-tests:apply
```

After applying cleanup, re-test the main flows:
- Admin auth/login and stats load in `admin-dashboard.html`
- User portal auth and data load in `user-portal.html`
 - Contract deletion from Contracts list removes Firestore doc and attempts PDF cleanup
 - Sign-out race hardening in `user-portal.html` (2025-08-17): `loadUserData()` snapshots `currentUser.email` and re-validates after async awaits to prevent null dereference when the user signs out during refresh.
# 🧪 Testing System Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive testing system for the Cochran Films admin dashboard and user management system.

### Read-Me AI Redesign Verification (2025-08-19)
- What changed:
  - `Read-Me.html` upgraded to AI-styled glass/neural design inspired by `popup.html` and `index2.html`.
  - Added "What's New in 2025" section; refined Hero with typewriter; subtle particles; Firestore added to Technology Stack.
- Quick test:
  1. Open `Read-Me.html` and confirm:
     - Hero headline cycles through phrases ("Admin Dashboard", "Creator Portal", etc.).
     - Navbar gains shadow after scrolling >100px.
     - Particles are subtle (gold/indigo) and interactive.
  2. Click "What's New" → cards render with CTAs to `admin-dashboard.html`, `user-portal.html`, `popup.html`, `index2.html`.
  3. "Technology" shows Firestore tile with Realtime/Scalable/Secure.
  4. Run Lighthouse or PageSpeed: ensure no blocking errors, layout stable on mobile.

### Modular Managers Firestore-First Loading (2025-08-18)
- User and Job managers in `admin-dashboard-modular/js/users/user-manager.js` and `admin-dashboard-modular/js/jobs/job-manager.js` now load from Firestore first and only attempt JSON API fallback if Firestore is unavailable.
- The legacy endpoints `/api/users` and `/api/jobs-data` intentionally return 410 (Gone). Seeing 410s is expected only if Firestore is not available. In normal operation with Firebase initialized, managers should not hit these endpoints.
- 2025-08-18 follow-up: `admin-dashboard-modular/js/users/user-list.js` no longer calls `/api/users`. It now reads via `FirestoreDataManager.getUsers()` (with a light in-memory fallback to `UserManager.state.users`). This eliminates recurring 410 errors from the user list refresh loop.
- Quick test:
  - Open the admin dashboard, sign in, and confirm users and jobs load without 410 errors from the modular managers.
  - Temporarily disable Firebase initialization to observe fallback behavior; managers will attempt the JSON endpoints and report errors (by design, since endpoints are deprecated).

### User Portal: Firebase Auth as the Gate (2025-08-18)
- `user-portal.html` now relies on Firebase Auth for login. After auth, it loads profiles from Firestore via `FirestoreDataManager.getUsers()`.
- The legacy `users.json`/`/api/users` reads have been removed from the portal. Contract merging also uses Firestore `contracts` collection.
- If an authenticated email has no Firestore profile, the portal auto-provisions a minimal user doc and proceeds.
- Payment method updates now write directly to Firestore (`FirestoreDataManager.setUser`) and no longer call `/api/users` or GitHub file APIs.
- Auth observer is debounced and guarded to prevent transient sign-outs during initialization; UI no longer flips back to the login screen on brief nulls.
  - 2025-08-18 refinement: increased null-auth debounce from 3000ms to 5000ms in `user-portal.html` to further reduce spurious logout flicker during slow Firebase init.

### 2025-08-19 — Admin init overlay removed; User Portal AI theme harmonized
- Admin: The modular app no longer shows an "Initializing Admin Dashboard…" overlay when the main dashboard is in control. The modular loader respects `window.MAIN_DASHBOARD_LOADING_OVERRIDE === false` and skips layout injection if `window.MAIN_DASHBOARD_USER_DISPLAY_OVERRIDE === false`.
- Files: `admin-dashboard-modular/js/app.js`
- Test: Open `admin-dashboard.html`. Verify there is no intermediate initializing banner; the existing dashboard styling appears immediately, stats load, and modular features remain functional.
- User Portal: Applied AI theme overrides (referenced from `index2.html`) without editing `index2.html`. A `.ai-theme` layer standardizes buttons/accents and softens legacy dark overlays so the AI background is visible.
- Files: `user-portal.html`
- Test: Open `user-portal.html` and verify buttons adopt the AI gradient and remaining gold/yellow accents are replaced. Background visuals should not be obscured by heavy dark overlays.

### Admin Dashboard: Non-admin Handling (2025-08-18)
### Admin Dashboard: Roles Removed + Single Job Title Input (2025-08-19)
- The Job Management "Add New Job" form now uses a single text input `#jobTitle` for the job name/title. It no longer uses a roles-driven dropdown.
- The Dropdown Management "Roles" section has been removed from `admin-dashboard.html`. Roles are now free-text on a per-user basis only (entered in the Add/Edit User forms).
- The Edit User modal now displays Role as a text input `#ue-role`. Any previous population from `dropdownOptions.roles` is skipped.
- Backward compatibility: if an older layout renders `#jobTitle` as a `<select>`, it is left empty and harmless; data submission still reads `name="title"`.

Quick test:
1. Open `admin-dashboard.html` and sign in.
2. In Job Management → Add New Job, type a new job title and submit. Verify job card appears with the exact title and stats update.
3. In Dropdown Management, verify there is no Roles block and no errors in console.
4. Edit a user → Role field is free-text. Save and verify Firestore `users/<name>.profile.role` updates.

- During initialization, if a signed-in user lacks admin privileges, the app no longer calls `auth.signOut()`. Instead, it shows the login screen with an "Access denied" notification. This prevents kicking users out of other tabs.
- File: `admin-dashboard.html` (init block around existing user check)

#### Hotfix: Login 405 and JS Parse Error (2025-08-18)
- Fixed a malformed async block in `user-portal.html` that caused a JavaScript parse error before `handleLogin()` bound, making the login form fall back to an HTTP POST to the page and return HTTP 405.
- Restored the `usersLoadInFlight` pattern and balanced braces in the users loading flow; linter is now clean on `user-portal.html`.
- Test steps:
  1. Reload `http://localhost:8000/user-portal.html` (Cmd+Shift+R).
  2. Open DevTools → Console; ensure no parse errors appear on load.
  3. Submit login; verify no network POST is attempted to `user-portal.html` and that Firebase auth proceeds.

Smoke test:
1. Open `/contract.html`, sign as a new user to ensure Firebase account creation.
2. Open `/user-portal.html`, log in with the same credentials; verify the portal opens without calling `/api/users`.
3. In Firestore console, confirm a user doc exists under `users` (auto-provision if not already present from contract flow).
4. Verify jobs and performance data load from Firestore and no 410 errors appear for `/api/users`.
5. From Current Jobs tab, change Payment Method; verify it updates in Firestore and the portal stays logged in (no auth bounce).

## Landing Page Slideshow/Header Merge (2025-08-17)

- The standalone header in `index.html` has been merged into the first slide of the pitch slideshow to focus messaging on creators joining the team.
- The logo is preserved and displayed at the top of slide 1. The original header copy is adapted for creators.
- CTA buttons on slide 1 now include a primary in-page CTA that scrolls to the jobs grid via `#jobs`.
- The jobs section root is now `section id="jobs"` for anchor navigation.

### Quick Test
1. Open `index.html` locally (or `https://collaborate.cochranfilms.com`).
2. Verify slide 1 shows the Cochran Films logo, the creator-focused headline/subhead, and two CTAs.
3. Click "JOIN THE ROSTER" → page should smooth-scroll to the jobs list.
4. Use arrow keys or nav dots to move between slides; ensure the last slide no longer auto-advances.
5. Confirm mobile swipe left/right still changes slides; first slide content fits and remains centered.
6. Verify jobs still load from Firestore (or fallback) and the Refresh button still works.

## Admin Dashboard Redesign (2025-08-17)

- New shell with sidebar navigation and routed content area is built by `AdminDashboardApp.buildLayout()`.
- Primary routes: `dashboard`, `users`, `jobs`, `contracts`, `dropdowns`.
- Rendering:
  - Users → `UserList.renderUserManagement('userManagementRoot')` (includes `UserForm`).
  - Jobs → `JobForm.renderForm('jobFormContainer')` + `JobList.renderJobManagement('jobListContainer')`.
  - Contracts → `ContractManager.renderContractManagement('contractManagerContainer')`.
  - Dropdowns → `DropdownManager.renderDropdownManagement('dropdownManagerContainer')`.
- Firestore manager is loaded via `../firestore-data-manager.js` and used with JSON fallback.

### Firestore Single Source of Truth (2025-08-17)
- The admin dashboard now reads/writes Firestore first for all data (users, jobs, dropdownOptions, contracts).
- JSON files on GitHub are optional archival only. Toggle with `SYNC_TO_GITHUB` flag in `admin-dashboard.html` (default: false).
- Realtime listeners are enabled for `users`, `jobs`, and `dropdownOptions`; UI updates automatically on changes.

#### Dropdown Options Schema
- Collection: `dropdownOptions`
- Document: `default`
- Fields (arrays of strings): `roles`, `locations`, `rates`, `projectTypes`
- The manager auto-sanitizes legacy numeric-key fields by promoting them into `projectTypes` and persists the fix.

#### Quick Test: Dropdowns load from Firestore
1. Open the dashboard → Dropdown Management section should populate without refresh.
2. In Firestore console, edit `dropdownOptions/default.rates` (add a value); confirm it appears within a second in the UI.
3. Use the "Add" buttons; confirm values appear immediately and exist in Firestore `dropdownOptions/default`.

### Quick Test Steps
1. Open `admin-dashboard-modular/index.html`.
2. Login; verify the legacy test UI hides and the new shell shows.
3. Click each sidebar item; confirm the correct module renders and actions work (edit user jobs modal, job apply progress, etc.).
4. Verify no console errors; Firestore presence is optional.

## Test Scripts
### 11. Portfolio Builder Smoke Test (2025-09-08)
Purpose: Validate Portfolio Builder core UI wiring, preview updates, and page load.

Commands:
```bash
# Local dev server must be running (node server.js)
npm test

# or with custom URL / headful
TEST_URL=http://collaborate.cochranfilms.com/portfolio-builder HEADLESS=false npm test
```

OpenAI configuration:
- Add the following environment variables in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
  - `OPENAI_MODEL`: Optional (default `gpt-4o-mini`). Recommended: `gpt-4o` for higher quality.

How it works:
- The page posts brand colors and style keywords to `/api/portfolio-theme`.
- The API asks OpenAI for a strict JSON theme (tokens, cssVariables, layout, components, meta).
- Returned `cssVariables` are applied live to the document, updating the preview.

Firebase Storage uploads:
- `storage-utils.js` wraps `firebase.storage()` uploads with progress callbacks and returns `{ downloadURL, path, size, contentType }`.
-- Supports `bucketURL` override; the project sets `window.FIREBASE_BUCKET_URL = 'gs://cochran-films.firebasestorage.app'` via `firebase-config.js`.
- The builder uploads to `portfolios/{ownerEmail}/{timestamp-filename}`. The user portal uploads avatars to `avatars/{email}/{timestamp-filename}` and showcases to `community-showcases/{email}/{timestamp-filename}`.

Quick test (old automatic testing system):
1) Profile Photo Upload
   - Open `user-portal.html`, sign in.
   - In Profile tab (or Community → Profile Picture), click Upload or Change. Both call a global `openProfilePicker()` exposed on `window` so inline handlers work reliably.
   - Select a small image (<5MB).
   - Expect toast "Profile photo uploaded!". Avatar shows immediately.
   - In Firebase Console → Storage, confirm file path under `avatars/<email>/...`.
   - In Firestore `users` doc, field `profilePicture` should be the public download URL (not base64).
2) Showcase Uploads
   - In Community → Share a Project, add 2-3 images and submit.
   - Expect progress text while uploading and a success toast.
   - Local storage `cochranShowcases` should contain `images` as download URLs.
   - Files exist under `community-showcases/<email>/...` in Storage.
3) Portfolio Builder Uploads
   - Open `portfolio-builder.html`, upload files, click Upload.
   - Observe progress and verify uploaded items render in preview using download URLs.

Publishing:
- Clicking Publish saves a Firestore document under `portfolios/<slug>` using `FirestoreDataManager.setPortfolio()`.
### 10. Firestore Job Assignments Alignment
**Purpose**: Validate the Firestore-aligned model (global job listings + per-user assignments) and UI wiring.

**What changed**:
- Global job listings now live in Firestore `jobs` collection (plus existing JSON fallback via `/api/jobs-data`).
- Per-user job progression lives under `users/{userId}/assignments/{assignmentId}` (status, progress, paymentStatus, snapshots), with JSON fallback via `/api/update-users`.
- Admin UI updates both Firestore (when available) and JSON for reliability.

**Admin UI points**:
- Jobs → each job card shows "User Status" + "Progress" controls with an Apply button. Applies to all users assigned to that listing (by `jobRef` or title match), persists to Firestore assignments and `users.json`.
- Users → "🧭 Jobs" opens a modal to manage that user's assignments (status/progress/primary/remove). Persists to Firestore and `users.json`.

**Testing Steps**:
1. Start local server: `node server.js` (ensure port 8000 is free).
2. Open `admin-dashboard.html` and sign in.
3. In Jobs, change "User Status" to `in-progress`, set Progress to `25`, click Apply.
4. Verify success toast; wait for 30s polling or refresh Users.
5. Open Users → "🧭 Jobs" for an assigned user; confirm status= `in-progress`, progress= `25`.
6. If Firestore is enabled, confirm the assignment exists/updates under `users/{userId}/assignments/*` and listing exists in `jobs`.
7. Toggle to `completed` with progress `100` and verify propagation to user portal.

**Expected Behavior**:
- UI changes persist immediately to JSON and Firestore (when available).
- User portal displays updated assignment status without breaking legacy flows.
- No errors when Firestore is unavailable (JSON fallback works).

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. User Deletion Not Persisting
**Problem**: The `deleteUser`

### Modular Portal Firestore Conversion (2025-08-18)
- User Portal Logout Hardening (2025-08-20)
  - Files: `user-portal.html`
  - Change: `logout()` now uses `FirebaseConfig.signOut()` when available with safe fallbacks to `auth.signOut()` and `firebase.auth().signOut()` and clears all session/local storage keys (`userPortalAuthenticated`, `USER_PORTAL_EMAIL_KEY`, `USER_PORTAL_SESSION_KEY`). Button updated to `type="button"` to prevent accidental form submissions.
  - Test:
    1. Sign in to `user-portal.html`.
    2. Click Sign Out.
    3. Expect: Notification "Successfully signed out!", login screen visible, portal hidden.
    4. Storage: `sessionStorage.userPortalAuthenticated`, `sessionStorage.userPortalAuthEmail`, `localStorage.userPortalAuthEmail`, and `localStorage.userPortalSessionExpiry` are removed.
    5. Refresh page: remains on login screen.

- Modular portal managers now load from Firestore instead of `/api/users`:
  - `js/auth/auth-manager.js`: validates user by querying Firestore `users` with `profile.email`.
  - `js/users/user-manager.js`: looks up user via Firestore and transforms shape for UI.
  - `js/contracts/contract-manager.js`, `js/jobs/job-manager.js`, `js/users/performance-manager.js`: read from Firestore by `profile.email`.
  - `js/users/payment-manager.js`: persists `paymentMethod`, `bankDetails`, and `paymentHistory` to Firestore.
- Ensure Firebase SDKs (app/auth/firestore) plus `../firebase-config.js` and `../firestore-data-manager.js` are included in `user-portal-modular/index.html`.

### Admin Strict Firestore Mode
- To disable JSON fallbacks in admin modular realtime utility, add before loading modules:
```html
<script>window.STRICT_FIRESTORE_MODE = true;</script>
```
- This prevents `/api/*` fallbacks in `admin-dashboard-modular/js/utils/realtime-data-manager.js`.

### 2025-09-08 — Edit User modal is viewport-safe on small screens
- Files: `admin-dashboard.html`

### 2025-09-13 — iOS SwiftUI App: CF-Job-Listings
- Files: `MobileApp/CF-Job-Listings/CF-Job-Listings/*`
- Scope: Native iOS app mirroring web job listings and apply flow.
- Config: Set API base in `Config.plist` (`API_BASE_URL` matches your Vercel deployment). Optional Firebase values for direct Firestore.
- Behavior: Prefers Firestore for jobs/applications if Firebase is available; falls back to existing `/api/jobs-data` and `/api/apply` endpoints.

Old automatic testing system steps (simulated via iOS app):
1) Seed at least one job in Firestore `jobs` with fields: `title`, optional `date`, `location`, `pay` (or `rate`).
2) Open the iOS app. Expect the Jobs list to load with Active filter on; search and location filter work.
3) Tap a job → Details page shows title, location, pay, date, and description.
4) Tap Apply → Submit with name/email. Expect success banner. In Firestore, verify `users/<Full Name>` has `application.status = pending`. API backup POST to `/api/apply` should succeed (non-blocking).
5) Disable Firebase in the iOS target (omit Firebase pods) → App should still load jobs via `/api/jobs-data` and submit to `/api/apply`.

Troubleshooting:
- If jobs do not load: verify `API_BASE_URL` in `Config.plist` and that `/api/jobs-data` returns JSON `{ jobs: [...] }` or `[...]`.
- If Firebase initialization fails: leave Firebase pods out or ensure `FIREBASE_*` keys are correct; the app will use the Vercel API fallback automatically.
 
### 2025-09-14 — iOS Firebase initialization via AppDelegate (SwiftUI)

- Files: `MobileApp/CF-Job-Listings/CF-Job-Listings/AppDelegate.swift`, `CF_Job_ListingsApp.swift`
- Change: Added a UIKit `AppDelegate` conforming to `UIApplicationDelegate` that calls `FirebaseApp.configure()` in `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`. Wired it into the SwiftUI `@main` app using `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self)`. Removed redundant configure call from `CF_Job_ListingsApp.init()`.
- Why: Prevent runtime warning `[FirebaseCore][I-COR000003] The default Firebase app has not yet been configured` and `[GoogleUtilities/AppDelegateSwizzler][I-SWZ001014] App Delegate does not conform to UIApplicationDelegate protocol`.

How to test (old script workflow):
1) Build & run the iOS app target on Simulator.
2) In Xcode console, expect to see no I-COR000003 warning. Optional log "Firebase configured: __FIRAPP_DEFAULT" may appear.
3) Navigate to Jobs → open a job → verify Firestore reads succeed (if pods installed) or API fallback works.
4) Open Messaging; verify Firestore listeners attach without errors.

Notes:
- Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is included in the iOS app target and is present in the bundle.
- If you removed Firebase pods, the code paths are gated with `#if canImport(FirebaseCore)` and will no-op gracefully.

### 2025-09-15 — Phase 0–2 Portal/Auth updates

- Files: `firebase-config.js`, `user-portal.html`, `contract.html`
- Phase 0 (Auth hygiene):
  - Fixed Firebase `storageBucket` to `cochran-films.appspot.com` and bucketURL to `gs://cochran-films.appspot.com`.
  - Login UX: added mapping for `auth/invalid-credential` and a "Forgot password?" button that calls `sendPasswordResetEmail`.
- Phase 1 (Identity persistence):
  - On contract signing, cache `recentSignatureName/email` in session and write `profile.name` to the user doc when updating `contract.*` fields.
  - On first successful portal login, if `profile.name` is missing but cached signature exists for that email, backfill `profile.name` and refresh.
  - Portal now prefers `profile.name` over doc id/email for greetings.
- Phase 2 (Current Jobs UI):
  - Replaced bulky vertical timeline with a compact horizontal stepper; added a compact button group (Details, Download, Message) in the job card header.

How to test quickly (browser):
1) Login: enter a wrong password → error should read "Invalid email or password"; use Forgot password to receive email.
2) Contract: sign a contract with a full name → Firestore `users/{id}.profile.name` is populated; portal greets by name after login.
3) Jobs: Current Jobs shows a horizontal stepper; buttons are compact and no longer stretch down the page.
