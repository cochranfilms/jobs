# Notification System Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Unwanted Popup Notifications Removed
- **Problem**: Users and admins were getting unwanted popup notifications every time tasks were performed
- **Solution**: Disabled `showNotification()` and `showEnhancedNotification()` functions in both user-portal.html and admin-dashboard.html
- **Result**: All unwanted popups removed, notifications now logged to console instead

### 2. Action Required Button Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Contract signed notifications were showing "Action Required" button even though contract upload is now automated
- **Solution**: Changed `actionRequired: true` to `actionRequired: false` for contract signed notifications
- **Result**: Contract signed notifications no longer show unnecessary "Action Required" button

## 🔔 Admin-User Communication

The sophisticated notification system properly handles communication between admins and users:

1. **User signs contract** → Admin receives notification (no Action Required)
2. **Admin uploads contract** → User receives notification
3. **Admin assigns job** → User receives notification
4. **Admin updates payment** → User receives notification
5. **Admin creates performance review** → User receives notification (Action Required - correct)
6. **User updates payment method** → Admin receives notification
