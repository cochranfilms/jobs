# üîß Firebase & Contract Deletion Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase User Deletion Error
**Problem**: When deleting users in admin-dashboard.html, users were being deleted from users.json but not from Firebase database.

**Root Cause**: Organization policy restrictions prevented service account key creation, making Firebase Admin SDK unavailable.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `api/firebase.js` to use Firebase REST API approach instead of Admin SDK
- Removed dependency on service account keys
- Added better error handling and user feedback
- Implemented graceful fallback to local data cleanup

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ User deletion from users.json works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Contract deletion with PDF cleanup works perfectly  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firebase user deletion requires additional authentication setup
- üìù Manual Firebase user deletion through Firebase Console recommended

### 2. Contract Deletion - PDF File Removal
**Problem**: When deleting contracts from admin-dashboard.html, contracts were removed from uploaded-contracts.json but PDF files weren't deleted from the /contracts folder.

**Root Cause**: GitHub API deletion was failing silently, and no local file cleanup was implemented.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced contract deletion logic in `admin-dashboard.html` with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Added local file deletion API endpoint `/api/contracts/delete-local`
- Implemented three-tier deletion strategy:
  1. Try GitHub deletion first
  2. Fallback to local file deletion if GitHub fails
  3. Final fallback to local deletion for any remaining files

**New Features**:
- Local PDF file cleanup when GitHub deletion fails
- Better error reporting and logging
- Improved success messages showing deletion counts

### 3. User Data Syncing in User Portal
**Problem**: Users logging in through Firebase weren't properly loading their job data from users.json.

**Root Cause**: User matching logic wasn't robust enough to handle case sensitivity and null email values.

**Solution**:
- Improved `checkUserInSystem()` function with better logging
- Enhanced `loadUsersData()` function with detailed console output
- Added case-insensitive email matching
- Better error reporting to help debug user matching issues

## API Endpoints Added

### `/api/contracts/delete-local`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Delete PDF files from local contracts folder
- **Body**: `{ "fileName": "filename.pdf" }`
- **Response**: Success/failure status with message

## Environment Variables Required

### For Firebase Configuration:
```env
FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyCkL31Phi7FxYCeB5zgHeYTb2iY2sTJJdw
FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:566448458094:web:default
```

### For GitHub Contract Deletion:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
GITHUB_OWNER=cochranfilms
GITHUB_REPO=cochran-job-listings
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Contract Deletion:
1. Go to admin-dashboard.html
2. Select contracts to delete
3. Check console for deletion progress
4. Verify PDF files are removed from /contracts folder

### Test User Portal Data Loading:
1. Log in to user-portal.html with Firebase
2. Check console for user matching logs
3. Verify job data loads correctly from users.json

### Test User Deletion:
1. Go to admin-dashboard.html
2. Try to delete a user
3. Check console for detailed messages
4. User will be removed from users.json (Firebase requires manual deletion)

## Manual Push Commands

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the fixes
git commit -m "Update Firebase approach to work with organization restrictions

- Replace Firebase Admin SDK with REST API approach
- Remove dependency on service account keys
- Improve error handling for organization policy restrictions
- Maintain all contract deletion and user portal fixes"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test All Deletion Scenarios**: Verify contract deletions work properly
2. **Monitor User Portal**: Ensure user data syncing works correctly
3. **Manual Firebase Cleanup**: Delete Firebase users manually through Firebase Console when needed
4. **Consider Alternative**: For full automation, consider using Firebase CLI or custom authentication tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Contract Deletion Issues:
- Verify GitHub token has repository write permissions
- Check if PDF files exist in /contracts folder
- Review console logs for deletion progress

### User Portal Issues:
- Check if user email matches exactly in users.json
- Verify users.json is properly formatted
- Review console logs for user matching details

### Firebase User Deletion:
- Currently requires manual deletion through Firebase Console
- Organization policy restrictions prevent automated deletion
- Consider using Firebase CLI for bulk operations if needed
